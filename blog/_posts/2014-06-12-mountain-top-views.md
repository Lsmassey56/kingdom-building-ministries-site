Not only have the students gained new perspective on how high and deep and wide is God’s creative handiwork, they have gained new insight into what Kingdom laboring is all about.  Mountain views at summit heights often provide the place and space to see God from new and fresh vantage points, to know the power of praise and prayer, to gain a God-sized vision of and for the world, and to learn how to lean into intimacy with God no matter how high or low life takes you.   Working hard, facing obstacles, overcoming fear, and learning to better depend on God and teammates has all been a part of the climb for the 16 Days students.   That’s where we’ve been.  *Where is God taking you these days to expand and clarify your perspective of his love, mercy, and grace?*
