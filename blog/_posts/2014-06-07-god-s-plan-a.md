In our most honest moments we ask such questions as: Does God love and care about the imperfect, unworthy, sin-soiled, untrained, and run-of-the-mill people of the world?  Deeper still, does God notice the likes of me?  And if so, would he ever consider employing me in accomplishing anything significant in his Kingdom? 

The answer to each of those questions is a thoughtful but resounding, “Yes!”  From cover to cover the Scriptures tell of a God who uses ordinary, everyday people to carry out his plan of love to the world.  Consider the likes of Noah the construction worker, Abraham the businessman, David the sheep herder, and Rahab the hotel worker.  None of their lives screamed “extraordinary and noteworthy” to the world.  But God’s ways are not like our ways.  He sees things quite differently.  He always has.  God sees fit to employ the least likely and seemingly most unqualified people to become his "Plan A" for reaching the world.  

And God didn’t change his strategy when Jesus entered the scene.  His masterful plan to transform and reconcile the world included the likes of fishermen, tax collectors, political zealots, prostitutes, outcasts, builders, antagonists, adulterers, skeptics, murderers, doubters, merchants, beggars, and thieves.  God has a way of engaging the whole gamut of humanity – from poor to wealthy, young to old, notable to unknown, healthy to physically limited, women and men, boys and girls, educated and non-schooled, fair and dark skinned, nationalists and foreigners. God has never stopped being an equal opportunity Kingdom employer.  Bank accounts, prominent leadership positions, PhD’s, and clergy cards all have their place, but God never asked for any of those things when enrolling laborers for his Kingdom.  God does, however, continue to enlist and count on humble, yielded, and obedient people as his primary way of accomplishing his story of love in the world.  

Do you remember in Matthew 9 Jesus’ solution in harvesting a bumper crop of people whose lives were ripe for love's picking?  **Laborers.**  Everyday, ordinary, roll-up-your-sleeves and do what pleases the Master kind of workers.  

If God has always used the often overlooked, undervalued, disqualified but yielded and willing people as his primary plan for reaching the world, is possible that his plan also includes you?   

It’s true, you are included in God's "Plan A."  And here's the kicker: there is no "Plan B!"  If you haven’t already, it’s time to make yourself available to God for laborership in his Kingdom.  Give him what you have, whatever you have, and see what extraordinary things he can do in and through you for his Kingdom’s sake.
