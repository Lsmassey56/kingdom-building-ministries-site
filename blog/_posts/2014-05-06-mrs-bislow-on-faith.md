“And without faith, it is impossible to please God” (Hebrews 11:6).

Faith.  What does it look like on a daily basis in your life?  Step by step, faith will be required along the path God has for you.  It’s time to move the calligraphy-styled *faith* art hanging on the walls of our homes to an active place in our hearts.  Jessica Bislow, wife of Caleb Bislow (founder of <a href="http://www.kbm.org/training/unusualsoldiers/" target="_blank">Unusual Soldiers</a> and author of <a href="http://www.thedangerousbook.com/" target="_blank">Dangerous</a>) has shared some very encouraging thoughts on faith with us in the interview below!  Caleb and Jess have said “yes” to a unique, God-given adventure of faith, and they’d like you to know that you can say “yes” too.

**Q: Describe faith in your own words.**

**A:**  Deciding...Deciding to take the risk of trusting God and watching to see what happens.

**Q: How has your faith grown in recent years?**

**A:** For Caleb and I, it was clear early on that the Lord had something in store for us.  We would take one step of obedience at a time and see the results!  Over time, this built confidence in hearing God’s voice, in following Him and in watching Him provide what was needed.

For example, I’m a horrible Bible storyteller – I can’t come up with anything on the spot!  When asked to say something or give an idea to Caleb, by mind is like a blank slate..."How about Amazing Grace??” I respond.  That seems to be the only thing I can think of!  However, when I know the Lord has asked me to share, I know it will turn out fine and it always does.  *The Lord is faithful to fill in the blanks when I fall short.*

Faith can go from small to big steps; it’s a process.  When Caleb and I were very young, there was a significant surrender moment for both of us.  We told God, “Yes” and kept saying “yes,” and that’s why we’re where we are today.  As you keep giving your “yes” to God and follow in obedience, you can’t help but grow in faith as you see how all of the “random” steps of obedience and “yes’s” mattered!

**Q: What helps you in moments of doubt, uncertainty and unbelief?**
	
**A:** Since I was little, my parents lived out their faith in a very real way.  So as I grew up, I was able to watch what a faith journey looks like.  Because of that foundation, I feel I’ve had a confidence in the Lord my whole life.

Yes, there are times I start to worry, but I catch myself quickly.  I remind myself that the Lord is in control...even when I mess up!  I know He will carry out the plans He wants to, I believe He wants to use me and I want to trust He can. I want to be faithful (Luke 12:48).  I know He’s bigger than me and *there’s a peace that comes when we believe He is who He says He is.*

>“If we are faithless, He remains faithful” (2 Timothy 2:13).

**Q: Is faith for everybody?**

**A:** Faith is for everybody.

The Lord doesn’t ask more of you than you can give.  He doesn’t ask for what we don’t have, he asks for what we have.  It all comes back to your “yes” answer to the Lord.  
It doesn’t make sense to pray, “Lord help me be a generous person because I want to give $10,000 to someone” when you don’t have $10,000.  But you might have $5 that the Lord will prompt you to buy someone McDonald’s with.  He wants to know we’ll be faithful with what we do have.  The more you say “yes” the more opportunities He’ll give you, which in turn will grow your faith…you need to walk it out day by day.

Caleb and I have a passion for everyone to believe that they have a unique story to live!  It’s story of faith that isn’t like anyone else’s!  We can often get caught in comparing our lives to one another, but comparison is a sin.  *I think instead of comparing we should be inspired*...inspired by others who have lived or are living by faith and keep saying “yes” to God on the journey we’re on.
