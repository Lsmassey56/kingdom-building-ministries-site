Save the date for this weekend's live streaming events!  

Saturday May 18th, from 8:30am - 10:30am (MST), Dwight Robertson (President and Founder of Kingdom Building Ministries) will be sharing *You are God's Plan A*!  God has a plan for loving and reaching the world - it's YOU!

Sunday May 19th, from 6:30pm - 8:30pm (MST), tune in to hear a message entitled, *Keeping the Main Thing the Main Thing*, from Dwight.  We pray it's a refreshing reminder that your intimacy with God is the greatest gift you will give this world.
