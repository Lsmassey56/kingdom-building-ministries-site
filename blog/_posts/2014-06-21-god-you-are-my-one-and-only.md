Redeemed.  Loved.  Forgiven.  Humbled.  Freed.  Awakened.  Changed.  Equipped.
 
The 18 students of the 16 Days team graduated today, commissioned as God's Plan A Kingdom Laborers.  The room was filled with the emotion of a close bond of a team about to embark on another chapter, and as staff and students shared, we sat in awe of the amazing love, grace and transformation God bestowed in each life.
 
"Graduation day is our most exciting day of the program," 16 Days leader Charlie Marquis said.  "Why?  Because today you are commissioned and sent to go and labor with God in the plans He has in store to use you to advance His Kingdom in your schools, homes, churches and communities.  You are equipped and have everything you need in Jesus Christ."   
 
Rob Cupp, Kingdom Building Ministries' Chief Content Officer, challenged the team to make God their *one and only*, and throughout life's journey to always keep Him there - resisting anything or anyone that will compete to take His place.
 
*Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. Matthew 22:37-39*
 
May your heart be encouraged as you read these highlights below of what God did during 16 Days, and consider the question yourself: **Will you make God your one and only?**
