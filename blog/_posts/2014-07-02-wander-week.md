This week The Experience students, divided into three teams, have been doing life together in three separate cities in order to better grasp what it means to live in genuine Christian community.  Convinced that people outside God's Kingdom will "know we are Christians by our love for one another" (John 13:35), the students have been engaging with one another and asking such questions as:  

- How will I genuinely love the people I encounter who neither know nor care about the real Jesus?  
- How can I share God's radical transformation in my life in a way that draws people to Jesus instead of causing them to run away from Him?   
- How has God wired me to share the good news of the gospel in unique, freeing, and life-giving ways?  
- How do I engage in the messiness of love with other Christ-following brothers and sisters in a way that outsiders looking in will see what genuine love looks like?
- What does it mean to love well in the unity of Christ-centered community? 
- How do I listen well to the Holy Spirit and allow him to daily lead the way? 

The Experience students have been engaging the work of "messy love" this week, and they've been discovering that while loving as Christ loves in community is difficult, it is well worth it!
 
>What has God been teaching you lately about the "hard but worth it" love both in your places of Christ-centered community and in the world around you? 

##Dallas Team
Yesterday, the team spent the morning navigating public transportation for the first time, and taking the bus into the city to join with a church and thrift store. They were part of a larger team sorting through large quantities of donated material for their thrift store and supplies they pass out to the poor in the city.

Prayer Requests:
Prayer requests:
- Pray that as the team makes ministry decisions, that they would experience unity of hearing God together. 
- Pray that the ministry opportunities they do engage would advance the Kingdom.

##Denver Team
Yesterday they had a great time serving at the Denver Rescue Mission! They were an encouragement to the staff and prayed over them.

Prayer Requests:
- Pray for health and for encouragement!
- Pray for open hearts on the team and for God to lead and guide them with wisdom regarding ministry opportunities.

##Vegas Team
Yesterday, the team went to work with Casa de Luz, helping with a food drive.  One of the pastors took the time to anoint and pray over each of the team members, believing that God has good and specific things in store for them this week!  Part of the team helped to distribute food while the rest of them hung out or played worship music for those hanging around.

Last night they split into groups of 3 to spend some time laboring on the main strip, and today they will return to help Casa de Luz again with the food drive. 

Prayer requests:
- Discernment as they sift through options for what ministries to engage - they have a lot of connections and opportunities and are seeking to know where to spend their time. 
- Energy: the team is in very high spirits, feeling encouraged, but could use an energy boost in the 110 degree heat.
