The students learned this past week that God uses our small acts of obedience to the Spirit's leading to usher in the Kingdom of Heaven just as much as He can use the "big ones."

As the teams returned to Denver from Wander Week, they were filled with excitement over the ways God had given the opporunity to co-labor with Him in.  A sense of wonder was also upon them, realizing this lifetime will never reveal the entirety of the kingdom advancement their small and big acts of obedience had.  But with the excitement and wonder came a humble brokenness while reflecting on the challenging moments - "How well did I display Christ-centered love and community within my team?  How often did I tire and grow weary of following the Spirit's leading?"  Successes and failures will come along this journey we're on, but what matters is that our Father in heaven looks and finds willing hearts.

>Will you be found faithful in the small and big moments to follow and obey God's voice?

*I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free.  Psalm 119:32*
