Humanity is on a quest for comfort—a quest for pleasure. The next time you sit through a TV commercial break, take note. You’ll soon hear the message: “You deserve to have what you want when you want it!” From the moment we’re born we start designing strategies to control our world—to crown ourselves the king of our own kingdom. The scream from my one-year-old son when his older sister jerks his Hot-Wheels car out of his hand proves he’s wasted no time perfecting his quest!

The problem is our reality. What actually happens in life doesn’t match the virtual world locked in our imagination. We often find comfort or pleasure for a moment, before it slips through our grasp like sand. When repeated efforts to reinstate our “kingship” fail, we simply change our strategy so we can keep striving for what we believe we deserve. If we’re honest, we may even blame God for the pain, suffering, problems and hurtful people in our life. At this point our circumstances have tested our belief in the character of God.

After 14 months of coping with unusual skin rashes and boils, I was diagnosed with a rare skin disorder that, according to the medical world, has no known cause and no known cure. Being a guy who loves outdoor activity, adventure, international travel and missions, this diagnosis and the challenges it presents hit me pretty hard. Slowly my reality exposed lies—lies I believed. I deserved health, freedom, and rewards for serving Christ, right? Ultimately, I began questioning whether God was good. Did he see me? Did he love me? Did he care? Yes, I know those are the wrong questions! But, faced with trial my focus turned inward.

The world condemns suffering. God employs it to grow our dependence on him and reveal his glory. The world says pain and hurt results from following the wrong path. God’s Word commands us to rejoice when we face trials of various kinds. Suffering persecution for our faith or enduring the pains of humanity and the trials of life can shift our focus. Are our eyes on our suffering or on the One who suffered for our sake?

Paul says: *“…we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope…”* (Romans 5:3b-4). James states: *“Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”* (James 1:2-4)

So, is God good? Let me ask, how do you define God’s goodness? A pain-free life? Positive circumstances? Happiness? Financial security? Health? Allowing my circumstances to define God’s goodness limits the infinite, glorious, sovereign God I serve. Better questions are: “Am I thankful?”, “Am I rejoicing?”, “Am I patient?” Do I—do you—believe what God’s Word says?

“The Lord is good to all, and his mercy is over all that he has made.” Psalm 145:9

“Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.” Romans 12:12

“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.” James 1:17

“Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.” I Thess 5:18“
