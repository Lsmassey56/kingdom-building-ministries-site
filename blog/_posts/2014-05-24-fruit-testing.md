Grapes, when pressed, produced their real fruit. So it is with people. If you want to see what's really important to you, let life squeeze you a bit, and out will come the "real" you -- your real attitudes, real beliefs, and real values. This week, The Experience students spent a few days feeling a bit squeezed beyond the normal comfort and control of their everyday existence. What they experienced was life as over 80% of people around the world know it on a daily basis. The challenge taught them a lot about themselves.
 
Some learned that they were much stronger than they thought they were. Some discovered that they weren't as physically, emotionally, and spiritually stout as perhaps once perceived. Some faced and overcame fears they haven't dealt with for years. Some saw a clearer picture of what's really important to them. Some realized that they cared deeply for those beyond themselves. Some were disappointed to learn that when push came to shove, self-survival reigned over caring for the needs of others. 
 
In short, through the experience of being lovingly "pressed and squeezed," students learned to better "get over themselves," to better embrace pain and struggle as an opportunity to be more God-dependent than self-dependent, and to better love, care, and relate to many with whom they will share Christ this summer and in the years to come. They learned to better say, like Paul, "because of how I suffered for Christ, I'm glad that I am weak. I am glad in hard times. I am glad when people say mean things about me. I am glad when things are difficult. And I am glad when people make me suffer. When I am weak, I am strong." 2 Corinthians 12:10
 
Where is life squeezing you, and what is oozing out of your "true" self? What bubbles out of your comfortable and controllable depths when people and circumstances heat you up a bit and out bubbles the authentic you? Does love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control and the like flow from your spirit ... or does fear, anxiousness, bitterness, envy, anger, control, self-preservation and the like surge from the true you? Perhaps like many still growing and learning in their continued relationship with Jesus, it's a combination of both lists.
 
Real life happens. And in real life -- pain, circumstances, tragedy, relationships, hardships, and the constant grind of daily life -- squeeze us toward some pressing questions: Will I be God-dependent or self-dependent? Will I rely on my own self-sufficiency or the sufficiency of the all-sufficient God? Will I love like Jesus does in my unlovely circumstance or will my love prevail only as long as it serves me?
 
**When life presses in, what kind of fruit flows out of you?**
