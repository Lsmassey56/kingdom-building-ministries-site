Epiphany.  The “aha” moment that Jesus, the Light of the World, shines on everyone and anyone with His light and life.  Epiphany is the realization that God is the God of “whosoever believes” (John 3:16) and that “in him is life, and his life is the light of all mankind” (John 1:4).  Epiphany is the unmistakable insight that the same love, light, grace, forgiveness, and freedom that illumines the hearts of those who follow Jesus is a gift to be graciously and generously shared with everyone, everywhere.

Paul, once named Saul (until a new heart, required a new name, to describe a new man), had a profound epiphany of such truth.  Saul was as religious as they come.  He had all the right pious pedigree.  He came from the right religious family, the right religious school, and the right religious affiliation.  One problem.  Saul’s heart was anything but full of light.  In fact, quite the contrary, Paul’s heart was darkened – shadowed by a faulty view and pursuit of God.  His right religious behavior was impeccable, but his right relational exchange with God was lacking.   All that changed the day Saul personally and profoundly encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus ([Acts 9:1-19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:1-19&version=NIV)).  His life exposed, his mind renewed, and his heart transformed, Paul spent the rest of his life using his time, resources, influence, and energy to reflect the Light of Jesus to others. 

Whether wise men to their countries, Paul to the nations, or everyday you and me to those in close proximity – Christ calls us to illuminate darkened people and places with the light of his love.  How might God reveal an epiphany of his light through you in your corner of the world, cubical, cul-de-sac or kitchen?
