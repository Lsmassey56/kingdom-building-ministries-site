The hope we have for seeing our communities transformed for the glory of God won’t come through any new truths or ideas.  The hope we have to see the change we desire is found in Christ alone and the direction He gave us through His Word.  It’s not time for new questions; His Word is not outdated.  Yes, God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow, but what He desires to do through you hasn’t been done before and can’t be duplicated.  You are a one-of-a-kind original created to uniquely influence the world around you on behalf of the King and His Kingdom.

We’ve chosen to highlight *You are God’s Plan A* at the beginning of the year for a reason.  Whether you’re already filled with excitement about a new year of kingdom laboring or you never knew God created you with His plan in mind, you need the map of God’s ancient-future plan in place as you step forward.

When was the last time you were reminded that God has equipped you to live in a way that brings transformational growth and multiplies followers of Jesus Christ?  Or in other words, when was the last time you were reminded that transformational discipleship almost naturally happens when you are in an intimate love-relationship with God and are willing to see and spend time with others around you?  Your intimacy with God is the greatest gift you will give the world.  

As you move forward into 2014, consider these two questions:  
- Is there a person (or group of people) God is tapping you on the shoulder to extend his love to?  
- Is there an individual God has placed in your life who you could pass a spiritual baton to and begin discipling?  
Pray and take action this week that brings you into closer relationship to the person or people God brought to mind. 

**An Excerpt from *You are God’s Plan A*:**

*Imagine if all Christians “woke up from their slumber,” apart from the two hours they go to church every week, and fully engaged in God’s Plan A for their lives the additional 166 hours. Imagine the new Kingdom exploits!  The possibilities around us!  Imagine if every Christian worldwide woke up and reported for duty!  Like the early followers of Jesus who announced His life-changing resurrection person to person, you can share His life, hope, power, and presence everywhere.*
