It's day two of Deep Camp and our gracious God has already spoken in many ways through many vessels why it is we came up 9,000 feet for camp.  

In the refreshing breeze of the mountain air, in spaces quiet and untouched, and even in the commanding presence of a storm, Jesus, the disciple maker, is on the move.  

Coming up the mountain, far from the ground we perseveringly walk and work day to day, we move closer to a posture which is stilled and longingly waits to hear Jesus' loving voice.  He is our Truth, Light and Salvation - the one who calls through the waters of our soul, sometimes stagnant and othertimes raging, and says, "Beloved child of mine, follow me."  Pastor Robert Gelinas shared with us this morning that our "*great co-mission*" with God is to enroll students (disciples) into school to be taught by Jesus Himself!  Consider yourself, who is discipling you?  May we settle for nothing less than Jesus, our Lord.    

Through worship, teachings, discussion groups and the beauty of God's creation, Jesus is on the move in each life here.  Thank you for your prayers.

*As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”  At once they left their nets and followed him.  Matthew 4:18-20*
