The 16 Days Team arrived!  God has already worked in miraculous ways in just the first two days.  Our God is GOOD, GRACIOUS, GLORIOUS, GREAT.  As we challenge the students this week with this truth, will you believe too?
 
Mark 8:34-35, "Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.  For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it."
 
But whoevever loses their life for -- not a mother or father, not a leader or institution, not our own ambitions or goals...but for Jesus Christ and the gospel, will find true life.  There is no greater ambition or greater joy than to know Jesus Christ, to let Him transform you, and to help move His plan forward.  When we water down the gospel with our own self-righteousness, religious checklists, comfort and unbelief, our lives become a reflection of ourselves and not of Jesus Christ.  The world doesn't need a great person alone, the world needs a great God.  The gospel matters in and through you.  
>Will you live to put Jesus Christ and the gospel story on display?

Days 1-3 of the 2014 16 Days Team.
