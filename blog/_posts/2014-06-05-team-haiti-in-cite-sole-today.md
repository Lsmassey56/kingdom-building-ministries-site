##Team Haiti
Team Haiti arrived safely yesterday, and had an amazing first day!  After being picked up by missionary host, Carl Gilles, the team visited a Compassion International project where they were blessed by spending time with the kids and received a tour by the Pastor and Compassion director.  Next, they were taken to the Gilles home for lunch, orientation and a quick nap. 

The next stop was the children's hospital.

Today, after a needed evening of rest last night, the team is ministering in Cite Sole, one of the most impoverished regions of Port-au-Prince.  They thank you for your prayers!

##Team Dominican Republic
Yesterday, the team ministered in a community near Puerto Plata and cleaned up a local basketball court where a basketball tournament will be hosted in a few weeks. The team came up with the idea to host an event TONIGHT at these courts, where they will play games, share worship, and give testimonies with the kids they have been playing basketball with the past two days.  {% include image.html url="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u422l9alifynavj/photo%202.JPG" float="right"%}
>Please be praying for tonight, for Gods Spirit to move mightily in hearts as the team shares Gods truth...through actions and words! ~Team Leader Nate Hoot

##Team Honduras
Team Honduras learned to be flexible yesterday as rainstorms held them off from our plans to visit the Mayan ruins. Instead they went to the local city square and the team was given a "team challenge" to complete, called the Abyss.  An hour into the the task rain started to pour, but they didn't give up! They went at the task for two hours, and even pulled in locals for help! The challenge was paused for the night, but they will revisit it soon.  While in the city square the team met an American missionary couple that are just beginning their journey in Copan! The team hopes to hear more of their story in the week to come.

>Since leaving Kingdom Building Ministries, we have been challenged with what it looks like to find ministry "along the way". Whether on a plane or walking the streets of Copan, there are ministry opportunities everywhere! ~Team Leader, Gabby Engle
