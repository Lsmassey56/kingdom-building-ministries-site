The 16 Days Team has recently been learning about what a life marked by grace looks like.  What about you?  Is your life marked by grace?  Take a moment and reflect on the passage below from Ephesians 2:4-10:

"**But because of his great love for us**, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions - it is by grace you have been saved.  And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in ordoer that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.

**For it is by grace you have been saved**, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast.  For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."

Grace, God's diving influence on the human heart.  Does your life bear witness to the following statements?
- This life you desire to live for Jesus Christ all began with God's great love for you, which is unconditional, relentless and passionate.
- In believing in Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, you are forgiven - the old is gone, the new has come, and a journey of continued transformation and growth is ahead.
- We are incapable of earning or performing our way any closer to Jesus Christ, our salvation is a free gift which seated us with Jesus Christ in the heavenly realms!
- Self-condemnation saddens God's heart, Jesus Christ has already paid your punishment and delivered you from death. 
- Our successes or failures do not add or substract anything from our given identity as a child of God.

Let God's grace bring freedom to your heart today in the areas which most challenge you.  You are loved, you are a child of God, and you are God's workmanship.  May your life be a glorious testimony to others as you bear witness to the transformation God's grace has had in your life.
