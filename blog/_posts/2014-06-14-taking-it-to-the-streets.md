Most of us do life right where we are.  We leave our neighborhoods and daily trudge the same routes to our work places, schools, shopping spots, and churches.  And, truthfully, that common sightline can reveal some really good ways that God is at work in our surroundings -- if we have eyes to see and want to engage.  But sometimes, opportunities arise when we are invited to move out of our regular travel patterns and dive into life in places not as familiar, and certainly not as comfortable.
 
Recently, the summer training itinerary took our students to the downtown 16th Street Mall area of Denver.  Just steps away from the drop-off bus, the students discovered sights, sounds, smells, and surroundings not nearly as familiar as their daily environs back home.  The homeless, the helpless, the harried, and the hurting flood the Denver downtown streets.  With all senses engaged, the students began to press into the reality of how the Holy Spirit would move in and among them to take them far beyond a mere training exercise to actually "seeing, stopping, and spending time with" real people.

Dividing the team into smaller groups in order to better camouflage themselves with the crowd, the students began their experience by spending some time sitting quietly and observing the activity of the city, making note of the demeanor, body language, and engagement of those who passed by.  Did they say, “Hello?”  Did the notice me?  Where were their thoughts,   motives, and feet taking them?

The Holy Spirit was to lead the way – whether to sit and be present, share God’s story or their own, or simply exchange words or gestures that say “I care, and you matter.”

A second day on city streets included students experiencing, if even in a small way, what it is like to be homeless, penniless, and truly in need.  This exercise required them to put some new kind of street shoes on for size.  Creativity, ingenuity, and laying down pride were all a part of the survival scenario.  They utilized public spaces for use of computers and internet resources, used payphones to call shelters, wrestled with how they might obtain money for bus fare if they were actually going to make way to the shelter specifically for homeless teens, and connected along the way with people of all colors, creeds, and conditions, who were now considered their peers – if even for the day.

They discovered a new set of lenses in which to view people more compassionately.  They found out that everyone has a story worth hearing.  Everyone.  And that God continues to write a much larger story of love that includes each person they observed and encountered. 

**Students took God’s love to the streets of Denver.  Where are you taking God’s love these days?**
