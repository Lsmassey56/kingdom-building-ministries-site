As Spring Break approached my freshman year of college, my life was filled with great expectation.  I had the opportunity for a free week on the beach thanks to my sister’s recent move to Florida.  Lightly packed with swimsuit and sunscreen in tow, I, along with a few traveling buddies, headed down Interstate 75 for our fifteen hour ride to paradise.  Until.  Until we hit bridge construction just one hour into our trip.  Now this was “back in the day” – so no cell phones, no GPS, no Google Maps, no detours, no nothin’!  In the words of a song that is almost as old as I am, “They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.”  Stuck.  The first 15-20 minutes wasn’t so bad.  But as minutes turned to hours discouragement and fatigue set in, and we found ourselves entertaining the discussion of “maybe we should just turn around and head back home.”

Maybe you’ve had a similar experience in traveling with God.  Life with God is good.  You have a sense of purpose and direction (perhaps for the first time … or the first time in forever!), and you’re headed off to experience and encounter God’s adventure ahead of you.  Until.  Until some unexpected incident, accident, or obstacle leaves you feeling stranded on the highway.  Patience turns to discouragement and you wonder, “Why this?  Why now?  I thought we were really going somewhere God?”  Perhaps you are tempted to turn around and go back to more comfortable and familiar places.  Detours, roadblocks, and construction zones can do that sometimes.

But here’s the good news.  God knows where you are and where you’re going.  He’s well aware of those barriers that seem to be getting in the way of where you want to, or think you ought to, be.  And whether the obstacles that stand in your way are self-constructed or otherwise orchestrated, God wants to use such barriers and challenges to draw you deeper into trust, dependence, and love *with* Him.  

While *our* sightline changes, *God’s* vision remains the same.  He’s got this.  He’s got you.  Will you trust the sufficiency of an all-sufficient God to help you navigate life and love when the journey takes unplanned turns, unwanted delays, and unexpected challenges?   Will you trust God’s promise to “go with you and never leave you nor forsake you” (Deut 31:6) no matter where the road or what the obstacle?   Adventure awaits.  It’s time to get in the car and drive.
