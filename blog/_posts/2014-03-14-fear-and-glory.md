Johnny Depp is terrified of clowns.  Matthew McConaughey is scared of revolving doors.  For Sheryl Crow, it’s heights.  Michael Jordan, deep water.  Nicole Kidman, butterflies.  Keanu Reeves, the dark.  Donald Trump, shaking hands.  And ironically, for the late, great Disney founder and king, Walt, it was the fear of mice that undid him from time to time, according to [neatorama.com](http://www.neatorama.com/).  

Fears.  We all have them in some form and fashion.  Can you name yours?  Can you place those people, circumstances, or situations that seem to put your health, life, status, power, plans, identity, or security at risk?  Can you call out the people or things that when encountered cause you to stop in your tracks, run, hide, shrink back, shrivel up, change your course, or behave in a host of other ways that aren’t really “you”?   While your fears may be overt and visible, such as being afraid of the dark, heights, snakes, or public speaking, your most detrimental fears are most likely much deeper.  Less visible and more threatening are the fears that attempt to keep you from knowing, trusting, and loving God.  The Enemy knows that if you’re focused on your fears, you’re attention is not on God but yourself and everything else around you.  

God understands your fears.  He knows that ever since that first deception, decision, disobedience, and distrust of Him in the Garden, we’ve been running needlessly scared of Him, but scared all the same.   That’s why God tells us well over one hundred times in Scripture, “do not be afraid.”  

The truth is, you may have to battle one form of fear or another until the day you die.  Fears such as control, failure, abandonment, acceptance, or loss are hard to shake.  God grieves your fears.  He knows you’ve been led to distrust Him, to replace His perfect sufficiency with a lesser version of your own.  

But here’s the good news.  Because God is glorious, we don’t have to fear anything or anyone.  Because God’s in charge of everything, everywhere – we can trust Him.  Even in our most out of control moments, our shakiest situations, and our most “curled up in a corner” fear-filled encounters, God can, and will, show His infinite worth and weight as we “lean not on our own [limited] understanding but acknowledge Him” in His altogether perfect and trustworthy knowledge and power (Proverbs 3:5-6).  And when we recognize the God who’s absolutely able and in control, our fears begin to subside, our perspective is renewed, and another opportunity arrives to put God’s infinite worth and worthiness  on display.
