As you may have heard on the news, Colorado has had some fierce weather!  To us the rain, wind, and hail have been reminders of the powerful way God moves and works!  In the midst of the storm, students are sailing new seas of the soul, and yet they rest in their Father's arms of peace.

"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid." (John 14:26-27)

We hope you enjoy seeing a glimpse of the past week!
