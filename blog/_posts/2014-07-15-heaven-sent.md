Peter, James, and John witnessed it firsthand.  Jesus had just healed a very sick woman, and greater still, raised a dead girl back to life (Luke 8:40-56). If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they may not have believed it.  But they did see it.  And they believed.  

Soon enough, the three disciples who saw, along with the other nine disciples whose faith would be tested in even greater ways, would have to answer the question, “How much do we really believe?”  It’s one thing to be awed by the professional at work.  It’s totally another thing to duplicate the feats of the master.

But that’s what Jesus called the dedicated dozen together to do.  Jesus says to them, in essence, “What I’ve done; now you do.  It’s your turn.”  Jesus gives them all the power and authority necessary to overcome unseen enemies and to bring wholeness to people in body, mind, and spirit.  And by the way, Jesus tells them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, no bag, no bread, no money – not even extra clothes” (Luke 9:1-5).  Not hardly an attractive sales pitch.  What kind of motivational talk was Jesus giving?  Did he want them to fail?  Not at all.  Jesus simply wanted them to depend fully on the power of God and nothing or no one else.

And God being God, it worked.  The disciples, having been sent with good news and God’s power, went to where the people were, and they “cured diseases everywhere” (Luke 9:6).

A short while later, Jesus multiplies the laborership effort.  After warning would-be followers about the difficult nature of following him “all-in,” Jesus calls together seventy more disciples and runs through the same spiel as with the twelve: “I’m sending you out to do what I do. Take nothing with you. You’ll have to rely on God’s power alone.  It won’t be easy.  But, oh, it will be so worth it if you do!” (Luke 10:1-12, paraphrased).

We’re told that the seventy come back from their hard-but-worth-it adventure with great “joy!” (Luke 10:17).  God was who he said he was, and he did what he said he would do.  Lives were changed … forever.

Great stories, aren’t they?  Where do these stories collide with your own?  Jesus calls each of us beyond the pages of the written text, not only to read about the power of his love and healing, but to actually engage in it. 

“As the Father has sent me,” Jesus says, “so I am sending you” (John 20:21).  Where are the places and who are the people to whom God is sending you?
