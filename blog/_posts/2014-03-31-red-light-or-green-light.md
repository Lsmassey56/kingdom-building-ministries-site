Decisions are easy when we are driving a car. We’ve been trained. At a traffic signal, even an observant 4 year-old can tell us what to do.  Green light…”GO!” Red light…”STOP!” Don’t you wish life decisions were that easy?

Many followers of Jesus sit with great anxiety and fear at the traffic signals of life. 

“What if I get it wrong?”

“What is God’s will?”

“I’m afraid I will mess it up.”

We pray. We seek God’s help and guidance. And often we still are uncertain and afraid. It is difficult to discern how God is leading us, yet we want so badly to please Him and do what He wants.

At life’s intersections, it is helpful to remember that God’s will is always tied to God’s character. Whether the decision is big or small, God will never contradict his own character in his leading of you. Our confusion comes from our own selfish agenda or our misconceptions of God.

I have struggled to summarize God’s character in a way that helped me to discern his will, until my friends at <a href="http://www.ctoministries.org" target="_blank">Called To Obedience Ministries</a> introduced me to “The 4 Gs.”  The 4 Gs have become a great way for me to remember God’s character while trying to discern if the light is green or red.

Each of the 4 Gs is rooted in scripture. Each one describes an attribute of God that I easily forget when the pressure is on to make a decision and move forward. I keep a card in my wallet with these four phrases on it as a quick reference to remind me who God is while I’m trying to figure out what He wants.

God is GLORIOUS, so I don’t have to fear anyone or anything.

God is GOOD, so I don’t need to look for satisfaction anywhere else.

God is GREAT, so I don’t have to be in control.

God is GRACIOUS, so I don’t have to prove myself.

Reading each statement helps every thought that is not from God fall into the background, making His voice clearer. In your moment of decision, this summary of God’s character will help you see the traffic signal more clearly and follow God’s will.
