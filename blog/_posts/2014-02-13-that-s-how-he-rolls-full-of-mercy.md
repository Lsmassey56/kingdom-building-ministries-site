Someone once explained grace and mercy to me in this way:

Grace is getting what you don't deserve (undeserved favor).  Mercy is NOT getting what you DO deserve.  

I once was living asleep, among the waking robotic, mastering in the predictable and the comfortable.  Living a life of comfortable misery.  I was happy enough, a smile to meet every day and every one - no complaints to speak of but dirty diapers, swollen ankles and a swollen belly. But then there was that loneliness and longing for more.  There was that dimming and swelling of light in my husband's eyes that spoke of a sparkle dimmed to a flicker by the worn parts of not operating within one's sweet spot, the spot in which God intends for one to shine, when they are so close to Him that they beam His light everywhere.  Snuffed out by our own poor decisions and moving with God in sight and yet somehow apart from Him, we walked wandering for a time. Empty and sparkleless. Presentably status quo.

AND THEN! And then.  God's mercy reached in and redirected two, now three, now four with fifth on the way,  people on a new adventure in a far off land across the Atlantic ocean to the Dominican Republic, watering seeds, some of which had been hidden even from the owner's heart, to set fire and ignite God's love within to love a people so lovely but some lost.  

God's mercy is what turned my, our, life around.  He did not leave us as we were (which is what we deserved, having lost sight of Him in the rear view mirror), but He extended His hand and favor to us and charterd a course for us that was in keeping with how He had bent us for His glory.  God's mercy and grace cocktail of love is among the sweetest and most savory gifts He lavishly bestows to those He loves, to the point that He will pursue us to bestow it, even though we may have turned our backs on Him.  That's just how He rolls. . . full of mercy. Amen.  

*God is all mercy and grace â€” not quick to anger, is rich in love.* 
Psalm 145:8 (The message)
