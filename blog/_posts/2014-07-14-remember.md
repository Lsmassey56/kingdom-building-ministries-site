Students returned home this weekend after an amazing graduation last Saturday celebrating an Experience Team who Rachel Reed, Director of Training, encouraged as "men and women who are owning the call of God on their lives."  As their physical bags were packed up once again for the journey, we envision them carrying some new luggage as well -- spiritual packs -- if you will.  We pray each tool learned, each lesson of surrender, each joy-filled memory and experience, each paradigm shift, and each iron sharpening relationship will travel with them wherever they go and remind them that they have indeed been equipped for the you-nique ministry God has in store for their life.  Throughout the Old and New Testament, in both the good and hard times, God's people are called to remember God's faithfulness, His perfect character and His promises -- we pray each student will do no different along the road ahead.  And above all, may they hear and respond daily to the voice of the King.

Rob Cupp, Kingdom Building Ministries' Chief Content Officer, encouraged the team with this verse at graduation, and we pray it is also an encouragement to you as you pause to consider the stage of the journey you are on with Jesus:

*His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. 2 Peter 1:3-4*

Our staff team was greatly touched by this team's willingness to say "yes" to God all summer long, and we will always remember a special act of love and service they gifted us with - a time of washing our feet.  Before Dwight Robertson, President and Founder of Kingdom Building Ministries, closed graduation in a prayer of commissioning, he offered words to rememember: "With righteous-holy-riot Kingdom swagger you knelt to wash our feet yesterday, and as I watched I understood Jesus' joy, realizing that the feet of the *world* will be washed tomorrow as you are sent - Praise God...The Harvest time is here and your generation will turn the tide - the baton rests securely in your hands.  And may we labor until the world will say, 'Father, hallowed be your Name.'"

##Student Testimonies
"As I tried to prepare for what I would share, everything I wrote fell flat.  How can I even begin to capture this daily journey with an eternal God?"

"I do have a place in the Kingdom!" 

"My mind has been blown away by experiencing the power of prayer and the reality that God speaks to me!"

"My idenity questions were answered...There is no doubt in my mind that I am loved and valued by my Father in Heaven."

"I am not fully alive without intimacy with God."
