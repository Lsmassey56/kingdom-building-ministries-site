“Lord, have mercy.”  A prayer uttered from the lips of the Psalmists in ancient days, a prayer uttered from the lips of God’s beloved worldwide in an on-going refrain.  “Lord, have mercy.  Christ, have mercy.”  We falter without the mercy — the tender compassion and gentle interventions— of our loving God.  

The refrain echoes, “Lord, have mercy.  Come quickly to my side,” from the souls of mothering women of all ages and stages everywhere. Motherhood brings a woman to her knees so quickly, and so often.  The mother whose womb remains closed, the mother whose child leaves this earth too soon, the mother whose heart is frayed by the realization that she is not and cannot be enough, the mother who bears the pains and joys of her children’s children.  

As a mom of three young children, Joy has watched and experienced the compassion of the Lord as His *mercy* has unfolded before her.  In a season of secondary infertility - before the birth of the second child and then the third - loneliness and darkness settled in on Joy and her family.  She questioned her own faithfulness, questioned God’s love for her and His approval of her.  She wondered if another child would ever be a reality in their young family.  But as the tenderness of God’s presence slowly shed a light that overtook the darkness, He spoke to her about the truth of His love for her.  

In the long-suffering of waiting, God wooed Joy to His chest and asked for the fullness of her heart.  He whispered to her that His love for her is not and never has been based upon her performance.  He invited her to come closer to His side with all of her fears and doubts, all of her hopes and desires.  As she did, she and her husband began to receive more and more mercy, those gentle interventions of reprieve and hope.  Not hope for a child, though that still remained, but an abiding hope in the God who held them closely and loved them irrevocably in any and every circumstance. “As I reflect on this time in my life and ponder the present and the future, I recognize His mercy has been, is, and will be new every morning,” Joy explained.   
>*The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases;
his mercies never come to an end;
they are new every morning;
great is your faithfulness. (Lamentations 3:22-23, ESV)*

We need not falter, nor walk alone. It is the prayer of the momma, and it is the heartbeat of God’s beloved children, “Lord, have mercy.”  His compassions do not fail.
