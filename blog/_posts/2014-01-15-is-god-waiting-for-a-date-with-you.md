So it’s a new year, and at the dropping of the Time Square Ball, you resolved to do things better – especially in the spiritual realm.  After all, something deep within you has been calling you closer.  You sense that the voice to deeper down and farther back conversations and encounters is coming from none other than God Himself.  One problem.  It’s two weeks into the new year and you’ve already begun dropping a resolution ball of your own.  Suddenly the idea doesn’t seem quite as urgent.  Satan continues his subtle whisper in your ear, “It’s just not all that important.”  Perhaps you’re overwhelmed at the thought of what it means to spend a significant amount of time with God.  Maybe you’re not quite sure how to go about it.  Perhaps your calendar is already filling up faster than you wanted or hoped, or the thought of being alone with God for a significant amount of time makes you feel as antsy and awkward as going on your first date.  Perhaps it’s a combination of all of the above.

If so, relax.  All of those thoughts and feelings are quite natural.  And you can be sure that Satan is doing all He can to deter you from the one thing needful – a life far beyond knowing about God to a life of actually knowing God intimately. 
Maybe it’s time to simplify your resolution.  Time to walk, even crawl, before you set out trying to run a spiritual marathon.  Here are a few suggestions on how to slow down, start easy, and really meet God where He wants to meet you.  This isn’t rocket science, it’s a relationship of God’s design.  He wants to meet you in significant ways and is ready to “draw near to you as you draw near to Him” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A8&version=NIV" target="_blank">James 4:8</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+29%3A13&version=NIV" target="_blank">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).  Don’t mistake the simplicity of these suggestions as elementary or unimportant.  God has always made the way to Him profoundly easy – we’re the ones that often overcomplicate things.

**1. Schedule a day and a time to be with God.**  Ink it in!  God deserves more than being “penciled in” and you need to be with God far more than most anything that would cause you to reschedule.  One thing’s for sure – if it’s not on your calendar, it’s not going to happen.

**2. Find a place where you can be with God without distraction.**  It doesn’t have to be fancy, just effective.  It could be in your car, at a park, in a secluded room in your house.  Make it comfortable for you.  As far as distractions – in whatever way you wouldn’t want to be interrupted if you were in the middle of a marriage proposal – do away with those distractions so that God can meet you in a most intimate way.

**3. Come with no agenda but God’s.**  In the most simple and honest way you know, let God know, “I’m here to meet you any way you want to meet me.”  Whether you listen, speak, read, write, pray, sing, dance, or do – let whatever comes next come out of genuine desire to hear from and respond to God.

God often speaks the loudest, not in the wind, earthquakes, or fire … but in the gentle whispers of His voice when we quiet ourselves enough to hear Him speak (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+19%3A9-12&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Kings 19:12</a>).
