##Team Dominican Republic
**Team Leader, Nate Hoot:** The team has finished strong the past two days, engaging CMA students through sports, mountain hiking, and evening spiritual growth content. Yesterday we also spread the gospel message into local Dominican homes as we distributed life-giving water filters. Tuesday morning we spent some time in downtown Jarbacoa shopping for gifts then prayer walking thorough the town square asking God to show us if there was any way we could practically communicate God's love to shoppers, shoe-shine boys and store owners. Some of the team felt led to engage one of the shoe-shine boys, offering our shoes to be shined, then buying ice cream and praying for him. Tuesday afternoon we hiked a local mountain peak called "Flattop Mountain" with the CMA students. Before hiking up, Laura shared the concept of receiving a "new name" (new identity) from God and challenged the CMA student group to ask God while they were hiking what new name he may be giving them. At the top we explained our names and shouted them over the distant city of Jarabacoa. Several CMA students and staff participated, sharing a new name God had given them, then shouted that name over the distant mountains as a declaration before God! It was so cool to witness God on the move transforming old identities into new declarations!

After debriefing the international phase of The Experience yesterday morning, the team split for the afternoon activities. The guys played a basketball tournament with the CMA students and the girls distributed the gospel message (verbally) along with water purification filters (physically) into the homes of local Dominican families. The team was blessed greatly to witness smiles on faces as God's love poured over them through the words and actions of our team members! Then for our last "youth night" with the CMA students, the team prepared a Q & A session where the students asked and discussed several deep spiritual questions. After that we led a foot washing experience for the CMA students. Many of them participated, and some even asked to wash our feet. It was powerful, confirming God is on the move in some huge ways in hearts.

For our final goodbye we roasted marshmallows and made s'mores over a bonfire, celebrating the time, conversations, and hope in Christ shared back and forth between KBM and CMA. It has been a rich time and we feel deeply blessed. The team is dreading saying goodbye (for the third time now) to a group of people that we have built deep relationship with. We leave today at 9am for Santiago to catch our flight back to Denver. Adios Jarabacoa. Gracious a Dios!

##Team Haiti
**Team Leader, Rachel Reed:** Sunday we joined the Thede family and worshipped at their local church. Dr. Kris translated the message for us and it was awesome to feel more participatory with our Haitian brothers and sisters. We are also learning that bringing greetings and blessing from your home is very important. John taught Colin a few phrases in Creol and the congregation loved hearing being blessed in their own language. It was awesome to see their response. A continued value that has come up during our time has been the priesthood of all believers and how the body of Christ truly is one. We are not separated by country, race or ethnicity. We are one in Christ.  The church service was another example of that. 

During the afternoon, we joined Haitian children's ministry leader, Jean Pierre, for kids club. We joined in singing, playing games and pouring out love on the 100 or so kids who had come to their weekly gathering. It was definitely a highlight for the team. Jean Pierre is an amazing example of a kingdom laborer. He is not a trained pastor, but has a heart for kids and daily gives himself away to them in various ways. He runs the kids ministry, is a volleyball coach, helps to run the compound we were staying on, and at any given time you will see him in conversation with people around. When our team left early Monday morning, he came to pray for us and told us that we were leaving too early and that we must come back. 

Monday the team made our way back to Port au Prince - a 6 hour drive over the mountains. We stopped at a beach to enjoy a day of rest and received a warm welcome when arriving back to the Gilles' home. 

As we debriefed, spirits were high and ready and engaged to finish these last couple of days strong. A couple of them were pretty open about how they are not ready to leave this place, as it has deeply captured their heart. We return to Denver, Colorado tonight!

(Praying over our hosts, the Theede family: Dr. Kris & Corey, and their children, Eli and Ana.)

##Team Honduras
**Team Leader, Gabby Engle:**  The team traveled to the beach on Sunday night and spent the afternoon on Monday by the ocean! It was a time of rest and reflection for us all as we sought the Lord for our final days in Tegucigalpa.  We were also able to participate in Alfredo's youth servie at his church the night before! Two of our students (Ashley and Andrea) shared testimonies and I had the opportunity to share the sermon. It was great to see what youth ministry looks like in another culture and to continue to build relationships within the church! Over and over again, we have experienced the beauty of God putting us in the right place at the right time. He is faithful!

Pray that our team would continue to engage the Holy Spirit and keep their eyes open for along the way ministry as we travel back to Denver tonight.
