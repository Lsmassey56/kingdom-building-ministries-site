On a day to day basis, being a mom or bearing the on-going desire to be a mom, mercy can sometimes seem far and intangible.  It doesn’t make it any less so, nor does it make God any less present.  Life comes, and sometimes it comes hard.

“All days are not grace,” she posted in a group on Facebook, asking for prayer.  “Today is very difficult for our family.”  No details given, but somehow the anguish of her heart is palpable over the electronic airways.  And so, those who know her and her family pray.  

*“Lord, have mercy.  Intervene, we plead.”*

It has been eight months since her four-year old son died from complications related to a congenital heart disease. The grief group meets weekly at her church.  And every week, she gets into her car to make her way to the church.  She ponders the reality that she is heading to a place where she can bravely face the deep loss, the cavernous hole one more time.  “This month has been really difficult,” she confesses.  “I don’t know what to do from here.”  

*“God, be near.  Lend your mercy.”*

Her grown children all live on their own, married with children of their own.  They travel to and from places throughout the days, they hold their own little ones and find their own way into parenting.  She quietly goes about her tasks not necessarily defined by motherhood, at least not in the same ways.  Her home holds a certain kind of quiet, the kind that waits for the pitter-patter of tiny feet, and yet is not lonely in its patience.  All along the way, she lifts her hands in release, giving her children and grandchildren over to the care of the Father.  “Protect them, and guide them.  Aid them as they parent and work.  And keep them in Your gentle care while they are very far from this home now.”  

*“God, thank you for your goodness.  We trust in your steadfast mercy, in your care for our grown babies.”*

A mommy pulls her little one near to her, a little one whose birth mommy lovingly entrusted to the care of a forever family.  Gracie’s ringlets brush her Mami’s face, and she utters a prayer for her precious gift.  And another prayer for Gracie’s tummy mommy.  

*“In your mercy, lead me.  In your mercy, lead mommy’s everywhere.”*

In the relinquishing of our control – be it in the overbearing days where grace seems absent, in the grief observed, in the flight of children from the nest, in the ache of infertility or the process of adoption—the heart longs for reprieve.  The heart of God remains a safe place in which to retreat and to experience mercy.
