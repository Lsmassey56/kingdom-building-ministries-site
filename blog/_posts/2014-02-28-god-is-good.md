“God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him” (John Piper).

Is it possible to be completely satisfied by God?  If not, our unbelief communicates that we don’t believe God is enough and we don’t believe He is 100% good.  How often have we heard ourselves say things like:

- “I really need…”
- “If I could just…”
- “If only Mr./Mrs. Right would come along…”

Is God enough or is He not?  

It’s hard to imagine anyone walking up to our all-glorious God to tell Him, “You are not enough.”  But do the choices we make and the daily un-rest we feel tell it all anyway?  What areas in your life have yet to be surrendered and find satisfaction in our Good God?

- Is God enough in my lonliness? 
- Is God enough in my pain and loss? 
- Is God enough through my temptation? 
- Is God enough to fulfill me?
- Is God enough when I don’t understand?

Continue to search your heart:
- Do I have any right to expect satisfaction elsewhere?
- Can any idol remain that offers false satisfaction and fulfillment?
- Is there any reason to withhold surrendering my life completely into God’s hands?

In times of doubt, remember Who God is and take heart.  God gave His one and only Son for you.  Before you were born He knew the plans He had for you, plans that He will bring to completion.  He holds the world in His hands.  He desires to turn any hardship and trial into an opportunity for His glory and your transformation.  It is His goodness that draws us to repentance.  He will never leave you nor forsake you.  He is entirely faithful to His promises.  He loves you endlessly.

>As you take a moment to fathom (as much as possible) our Good God, what will your response be?

*The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.  He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  Surely goodnesss and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.* (Psalm 23)
