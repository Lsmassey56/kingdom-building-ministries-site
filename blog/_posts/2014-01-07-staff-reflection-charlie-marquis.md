Jesus is the light of the world. He is not only the light in our circumstances. He really is the light of ALL NATIONS. This is an amazing truth. 

I cannot help but reminisce the times I have tasted and seen the goodness of Christ in other countries, in homes, and on the streets, in cities, and in remote places. He is always at work, drawing the hearts of men, finding what is lost…
In the danger of remote tribal group, two women courageously defied threats of being beaten and committed their lives to Christ after hearing about Him for the first time.

In the brokenness of a red light district, the Holy Spirit moved powerfully in a time of prayer for several prostitutes. One woman declared that she would no longer work the street but trust God to provide all her needs.
In the vicinity of a mosque, a young Muslim man pondered the reality of Jesus, while fearing his family’s reactions. He deeply desired to follow Jesus wondering what may come of his life if he did.

In a village run down by the past horrors of communism, a young boy happened to be the despised of the despised simply because of his ethnicity. He gave his life to Christ, joyously smiling as he said “you all are like my moms and dads.”

What do all these have in common? Jesus. Redemption. All of these reveal simply broken people who have encountered the amazing grace of Jesus Christ and been made whole! God is truly revealing His heart for the nations, to bring His hope to every tribe, tongue, and people. 

May we never forget the vastness of Christ’s light. Jesus really is shining in all edges of the globe – no matter how remote, dark, dangerous, or despised. 

Whenever you ponder Jesus as the light of the world, take a moment and pray for those who are shining His light in some of the darkest places. Be inspired by their examples. And, courageously let Christ’s light shine through you in the everyday ordinary places you set foot. For Jesus said “YOU are the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden.”

All for King Jesus!
