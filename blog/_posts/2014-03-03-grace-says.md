When was the last time you stopped to hear what grace has to say?

Performance – it’s an obstacle I’ve struggled with for most of my life.  Get the top grades, do the best job, win the sports game, have awesome quiet times, be the perfect friend, share Jesus with the world, all while measuring my performance along the way.  I chuckle even writing all of that – what an exhausting way to live!  How quickly our desire to honor God with our best can lead to a life that is completely self-reliant, prideful, discouraged, tired, and void of grace.

One day at college while ordering a turkey sub for lunch, a friend of mine introduced me to grace.  “Lisa, what’s up?  Are you doing ok?” she said.  “Oh hi,” I sighed, slightly startled as I had no idea she had been watching me in the line…my eyes filled with tears.  “I’m just frustrated,” I said.  “My heart is so hungry to grow with God and share His love, but my quiet times are just off lately.  I don’t have the words to say to people, and I don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere.”  She quickly realized I was a case with no grace.

What she proceeded to share with me was the start to a complete paradigm shift in loving God and serving Him.
- Grace is God’s divine influence on the human heart.
- It’s His grace that makes our relationship with Him possible!
- His grace enables us to participate in Kingdom laboring work.

Furthermore, grace deconstructs any performance or measurement mentality we may have.  I used to feel like God couldn’t use me unless I had built up enough perfection in my relationship with Him.  The moment I stumbled in sin, defeat would wash over me, I felt unusable and “loved less”.  Have you been there?  If so, may our pride die.  Even on our “best days,” our own righteousness is still filthy rags, and God chooses to work through us anyway!  He loved us before we were even formed!  Be free!  Stop trying to “be enough” – that’s God’s job.  

Are you a case with no grace today?  Tired of making the rounds of performance and defeat?  Freedom, joy, and abounding love are yours in Jesus Christ.  So go ahead, keep on growing your intimacy with God and laboring…but with every breath and step, thank God for His grace that made it possible in the first place.

*But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions – it is by grace you have been saved.  And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.* Ephesians 2:4-7
