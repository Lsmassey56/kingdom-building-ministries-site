Mercy in the monumental moments of life we often understand.  A son breaks a most treasured heirloom and mom says to him, “It’s okay, people are more important than things,” and really means it.   A wife is unfaithful in marriage and her husband graciously welcomes her back without constantly “making her pay for it.”  A teenager steals from his neighbor to buy drugs, and the neighbor says to the judge, “I want to drop the charges, he has too much potential to waste in jail.”  Mercy in the big moments we get.

But what about mercy in the monotony of everyday life?  What about mercy in the moment?  Are we allowing God’s mercy to break into our daily encounters and conversations in a way that hope fills hopeless situations and God’s love fills lifeless living by the way we relent, release, and restore others? Maybe it’s as simple as blessing the family member who ate the last piece of pie that was supposedly saved for you.  Maybe it’s letting the guy in the car who intentionally speeds up to get ahead of traffic in the construction lane “squeeze in” without giving him words, gestures, or curses under your breath.  Maybe it’s as simple as silently praying, “Lord, come into their woundedness” the next time unkind and injurious words come flying your way.  And maybe it’s a constant awareness and conversation with God as you ask, “Lord, where are the people crying out in hopelessness and helplessness that you want to somehow show mercy to through me?”

Is mercy a part of your everyday moments?  How is God calling you to a deeper life of having mercy as He so relentlessly has mercy on you?
