Josh Zimmerman is a 2012 KBM alumni of [The Experience](http://www.kbm.org/training/theexperience/).  After growing up his entire life in Pennsylvania, Josh heard a call from God to “go west,” and moved to Colorado just over a year ago.  Josh recently shared with us what life after KBM has been like and what it means to keep walking in the light.  Below are a few segments from the conversation.

**Q: What has God taught you in the last year since you’ve left things behind to follow Him?**

**A:** Surrender.  Just going back the first three months I moved to Colorado without a job – pursuing job after job with nothing happening and becoming so frustrated.  I was reading the story of Exodus one day where Moses is standing in front of the Red Sea, and I heard God say to me, “Do you trust me to part these waters?”   God was asking me, “Are you going to set down your pride, surrender, and just trust me?”  At that point I said, “I’ve got nothing else to lose, so here we go.”  And God was there every step of the way. 

**Q: What would you say is the difference between talking about the adventure and actually living it?**

**A:** Talking about it, you have a plan.  But your plans never turn out the way you expect. Something is going to happen.  Poop is going to hit the fan.  That’s why you have to trust God and believe what you’re doing is right … because if you don’t trust and believe God, and your own agenda and your pride steps in the way, things go into mass chaos.  You’re still going to feel things are crazy at times … but [in trusting God] there’s a peace in it.

**Q: What did you do when the roadblocks and challenges hit?**

**A:**  I thought I was a failure.  Then I went into a mode of “I’m not good enough and what did I do wrong?”  But now as I look back, it wasn’t anything that I did, but God telling me to wait.  There were a lot of lessons of waiting and trusting and surrender.

**Q: Was there a turning point when things began to come together?**

**A:** I think I began to kind of chill out after I gave up.  Like in that whole Moses analogy … once I began to understand that “He’s got this. He hears my cry. He hears my plea.”  I knew He knew all about my situation and He had it well in control.  

**Q: In retrospect, why do you think God has led you to where He has you now?**

**A:** It’s the people I come in contact with, the employees I work with.  God has given me the opportunity to know their stories inside-out, and I’m not afraid to ask them deep questions.  For example, there was one employee who I was talking with in my office, and all of a sudden their story is coming out of their mouth and they're crying.  Totally just a God moment.  And I had a chance to pray with them.  And I’m like, “I get it. There’s a reason I’m here!”

**Q: Is living the adventure of a hard journey with Jesus worth it?**

**A:** It’s so worth it.  After moving out here and going through all that craziness, God has wrecked me.  But I’m so excited … because now I’m like, “I want more!”  It’s like wading out into the water with Jesus, going a little deeper, a little deeper, a little deeper.  It’s scary, but it leaves me wanting more!
