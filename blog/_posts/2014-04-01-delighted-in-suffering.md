Think for a moment about the things in life that you delight in the most…is suffering on the list?

Through scripture and the example of Jesus’ life, we discover that:
- It is our joy to suffer for and with Christ (Matthew 5:10-12, Philippians 1:29, James 1:2-4) 
- Suffering is a tool God can use to transform us into His image (Philippians 3:10-11, Hebrews 12:1-13, Romans 5:3-5)
- Suffering brings us into greater dependency upon Christ (2 Corinthians 12:9-10)
- Suffering helps us be more effective ministers to others enabling us to share the comfort we’ve received with others (2 Corinthians 1:3-7)

Did your shoulders tense up a little as you read those bullets?  We all respond a little differently to the reality of suffering.  For some, our initial reaction is fear.  The recent story you heard of a missionary suffering imprisonment and torture for claiming Jesus as Lord comes to mind, and you think “I couldn’t handle that.”  Or our thoughts turn to a friend we know who is suffering from a chronic illness and our heart sinks, wondering if our faith could stand the test.  For others, self-reliance will be the attitude that arises.  You think in terms of William Ernest Henley’s words, “I am unconquerable, the master of my fate and the captain of my soul.”

But these reactions fall short of total belief in the God whom we say our trust is anchored.

Our God is GOOD.  Our God is GREAT.  Our God is GLORIOUS.  And our God is GRACIOUS.  We must believe God’s perfect character, and then take our belief another step forward → We must believe He is sovereign, even (especially) in our suffering.

In the context of God’s eternal purposes and plan, our suffering is not a surprise to Him, and Jesus has shared in any suffering we may face.  Be assured of this – because God’s character is good and glorious, He already has a plan in place to use our suffering to display His goodness and glory.

Romans 8:28 says, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”

What portion of your heart is fully on board trusting God’s sovereignty?  What portion of your heart believes God will supply what you need to endure the suffering that will come?  Search your heart.  Is there a perfect piece of God’s character or truth you’re resisting?  Confess it to Him, right now even, and invite the deeper work only God can do to take place.

If you’d like to dig deeper, <a href="http://www.kbm.org/speakers/adrian-despres/" target="_blank">Adrian Despres</a> shares a powerful message entitled, <a href="http://kbm.donorshops.com/product/AD0002/delightedinsufferingcd.php" target="_blank">Delighted in Suffering</a>.  “Would you be willing to die for Christ?  That’s easy.” Adrian says.  “But…are you willing to *liv*e for Him?”  Be prepared to be challenged!
