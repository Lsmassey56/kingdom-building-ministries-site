Have you ever been asked to mentor someone and in the middle of saying, “yes” thought, “what is it that I am even committing to?” Throughout Scripture we see examples of people living life together and intentionally baton passing spiritual wealth to those around them. 

In today’s society, where discipleship, mentoring and coaching may mean different things to different people, there are a few thoughts we would offer as you intentionally pour into the life of another:

- **Have genuine intimacy with God.** Our personal intimacy with God is the backbone of this relationship - otherwise, it’s just human wisdom.

- **Journey “with.”**  Travel with the individual through successes and failures, maturity and immaturity, struggles and triumphs…theirs and yours.

- **Be graciously honest.** Have a willingness to say hard things in gracious love.

- **Listen between the lines.** Hear the deeper yearnings, truths, and conversations of the heart of a person beyond what he or she may verbalize.

- **Have a willingness to stir the pot.** Challenge, question, and disrupt the person beyond his or her comfortable “box” for the purpose of greater growth.

- **Have a willingness to say, “I don’t know.”** Have a genuine humility to not have all the answers all of the time.

- **Have a teachable spirit.**  Have a desire to learn, grow, and be stretched by God and the person you’re in relationship with.

- **Have the patience of Job.** Be as patient with the growth of the individual as God is with your own growth.

- **Don’t objectify the individual, but genuinely love.** They aren’t a project to “fix” but a person, created by God, to genuinely love.

- **Encourage as an “on your team” player.** Build the individual up toward Christ-likeness in both affirming and lovingly challenging ways.

- **Exercise discernment.** Listen “for” and “to” God’s voice and respond accordingly.

- **Coach toward Kingdom laborship.** Help the individual continue to discover God’s plan and purpose in glorifying God in His Kingdom.

- **Give grace in the journey.** Know that the individual, like yourself, is a work in progress and needs “room to grow” and opportunities to “do it better the next time.”
