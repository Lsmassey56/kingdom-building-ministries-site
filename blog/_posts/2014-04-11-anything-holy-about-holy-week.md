About this time every year, those who observe the Jewish Passover ask a very pointed question as they celebrate a first night feast called Seder: "Why is this night different from all other nights?” asks the youngest child present.  What follows is a retelling of the story of how a powerful and loving God moved his people from slavery to freedom, from death to life … and how he still does.

What a great question for us who walk in the way of Jesus.  As we approach the week ahead, called Holy Week, the question is posed to us: “Why is this week different from all the other weeks?”  Great question indeed, with many more follow:  Will the week ahead actually look any different for you?  Will you “set aside” the week as “holy,” as its name implies?  Will you take the time to re-position your thoughts and days to walk with Jesus once again from hallelujah cheers to blood-sweating prayers to the joyous echoes of an empty tomb?   Will you remember all over again what you’ve been saved from and what you’ve been saved for?  Will you pause long enough to adequately praise the One who makes all things new?

Over the next week, we hope you’ll daily visit the blog.  Our desire is to be a bit of a compass for you to help keep your thoughts centered on Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.  More than knowing about him, we pray that next week will draw you closer to him.  We hope your prayer continues to be, “ I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death” (Philippians 3:10).

Let’s end where we begin: “Why is this week different from all the other weeks?”
