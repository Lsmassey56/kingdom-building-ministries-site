There's nothing like standing at the base of Mt. Rushmore and gazing upward into the giant chiseled edifices of four historic presidents to remind us that legacy matters.  

A few years ago, one of the final scenes of the movie, *National Treasure II*, was filmed atop Mt. Rushmore.  As the plot unfolded, what the characters discovered was an unfathomable wealth of gold and diamonds within the caverns of the national monument. Talk about valuable treasure! 

While that story is fictitious, the 16 Days students recently discovered that everyone has a wealth of legacy to discover and share.  The question for them, and us, however, is "What is the legacy will you live in order to have a worthwhile legacy to leave?"  How has God blessed you to be a blessing – not just to your children and grandchildren but to generations far beyond you?  Will you leave a legacy of tangible and fading things or will your gift be spiritual and eternal?
 
Life is short: order your days wisely. Eternity is long: live for things that will last forever.  People matter most: focus your legacy on relationships. You are now living the legacy you are leaving.  How’s that working these days?
