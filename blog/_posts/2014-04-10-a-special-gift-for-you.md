##An Invitation to Journey with Jesus through Holy Week and Easter

So many of you have blessed us with your prayers, gifts, and presence in laboring together for God's Kingdom, we wanted to offer a blessing to you.  Below is a link to download a free daily guide and devotional resource from Kingdom Building Ministries that will lead you through Holy Week and Easter.  

If you would enjoy receiving the devotions by email each day next week, simply click the sign-up link below, and we'll be more than happy to oblige. 

Our prayer as you retrace the steps of Jesus' journey from the hills of Gethsemane, to the foot of the Cross, to the echoes of the empty tomb, is that you will encounter Jesus, the living Lord, in a new and fresh way.
