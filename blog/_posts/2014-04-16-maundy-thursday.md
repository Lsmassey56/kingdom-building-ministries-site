**What’s worth remembering about today: True Communion + Dirty Feet**

Love, in its most complete expression, is a verb.  That is, love manifests itself in the doing.  That’s why Jesus, the last night of his earthly life, chose to express the fullness of his love in ways that would send echoing effects to the present day.  

Jesus’ first gift that night was to provide a way to remember his love forever.  In taking and giving the bread and cup, Jesus made available the opportunity to remember and experience, “as often as you do this,” the redeeming and restoring love of his broken body and spilled blood.

Jesus’ second gift that evening was to demonstrate what real love looks like.  Imagine Jesus, King of kings and Lord of lords, taking the posture of the lowest servant as he stoops to wash his disciples’ dirty feet.  Imagine Jesus washing your feet.  “Do you really want to involve yourself in love,” Jesus says in essence, “this is what it really looks like.” 

Love is not only in the mystery of Holy Communion but is made manifest as we, in servant-like fashion, stoop to wash the feet of others.  

**Something to ponder today:**

Does my intimate communion with Jesus compel me to stoop and wash the dirty feet of those he places before me?

**Experience it in the Word:**

Matthew 26:17-75 | Mark 14:12-72 | Luke 22:7-65 | John 13:1-18:27
