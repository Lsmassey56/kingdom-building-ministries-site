“At the Lord’s command Moses recorded the stages of their [the Israelite’s] journey” (Numbers 33:12).  And so the chapter goes something like this:
*They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.  They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.  They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.*
They left ________ and camped at __________.

On the macro level, this is a pretty boring chapter to read in scripture.   However, think of all the change happening on a micro level, within the hearts and minds of every person with every new campsite.  Fickle and grumbly as the Israelites were, God used those 40 years to form the them into a people of His own, to write His Word upon their hearts, to fulfill the promise He made to Abraham that they would be as countless as the sand on the seashore, and to ultimately prepare them to walk in their new identity within the land of Canaan.

“From Desert to Desert” you might title their chronicle, but the New Testament writers give us even higher perspective.  “From Glory to Glory” and *ever-increasing* glory Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 3:18.

Might we say for every new “campsite” comes an opportunity for hearts to surrender and be made new in Christ’s image?  If God led the Israelites with a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night from desert to desert (or glory to glory) to display His goodness and graciousness to them, how much more, after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, do you think God leads us to opportunities for our sinful nature to die so His new creation might live within us?

Are you willing to submit to the journey God has set in place for you?  The new creation within us, more often then not, grows out of death and deserts, wandering and waiting…and God calls it all glorious.  

Will you trust Him and surrender to His good and perfect plan?  Even as His pillar of cloud and fire leads to unknown and unexpected campsites?  

2 Corinthians 3:18 (KJV) - 
*But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.*
