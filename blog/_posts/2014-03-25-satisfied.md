What satisfies you?  You know, that thing that gives you a sense that all is well and good in your life.  Is it a good meal?  A healthy body?  A fat checking account?  A completed “to do” list?  A favorite team victory?  An on-track relationship?  A successful job?  A bargain buy?  A “way to go” from a parent, teacher, boss, or friend?  An endless number of social media hits?  A Snickers candy bar?

Whatever “it” is, be assured, there is an “it.”  The desire for satisfaction is as deep as one’s soul.  It’s a thirst that must be quenched.  We all go looking for it in one form or another, and none of us feel okay without it.  The question is, and forever will be, “what satisfies the deepest longings of your soul?”

How often we look for the one big thing or the accumulation of a thousand little things to satisfy.  Our restless spirits remain in a state of dissatisfaction as we reel off a series of “if only … then …” kind of litanies.

We often chase endlessly what our gut knows is futile instinctively - that somehow “making the world our oyster” will somehow do the trick.  Actor and comedian, Jim Carrey, once noted: “I wish everyone could get rich and famous and have everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that’s not the answer.”  Still, many vainly wander down the path of fruitless toil only to discover what wise King Solomon declared: “it’s all meaningless and like grasping for the wind” (Eccl 2:17).

Noted theologian and apologist, Ravi Zacharias, accurately states: “The loneliest moment in life is when you have just experienced what you thought would deliver the ultimate and it has let you down.”

We were created as such that we will only be satisfied in God alone.  Only when He is enough will we stop grasping for empty rainbows.  The psalm-writer says it this way, “Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup … apart from you I have no good thing” (Psalm 16:5, 2). 

God is good, and He alone satisfies.  Why look anywhere else?
