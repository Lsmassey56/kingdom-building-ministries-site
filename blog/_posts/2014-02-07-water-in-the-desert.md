Titanyen is a desolate, desert village in Haiti, whose name means “little nothing.”   Two hundred youth ministers and workers from all four corners of the country gathered in early January at a missionary compound in this remote Haitian town for one purpose: to have their hearts moved, their minds quickened, and their spirits ignited in order to live out -- and pass on to the “youth” (ages 14 to nearly 30) they daily encounter “back home” – a passionate and intentional love for God and others.  What was most unusual about this gathering was that, in Haiti, youth conferences and training experiences like this just don’t happen.  But God had a plan.  And His fingerprints proved to be all over this first time ever event.   Accompanied by KBM staff member, Rob Cupp, <a href="http://www.kbm.org/speakers/john-vermilya/" target="_blank">John Vermilya</a> was invited to share God’s Word for the week with these eager and unpaid youth volunteers, many who came by way of great personal sacrifice, and all who journeyed out of a great passion to better love God and share His message of hope with young people they greatly love.

Speaking from the book of I Timothy, John challenged and encouraged those gathered that “if you have a Bible and passion for the Lord, you have enough to do ministry!”  After a full week of learning and worship encounters, spiritually full youth workers returned to their own labor fields with a domino in hand to remind them of the “Paul to Timothy” daily effect they have on youth and that God is counting on them to help raise the next generation of Kingdom laborers in Haiti.  

Imagine this beautiful picture:  In the obscurity of Titanyen, the “little nothing” village, hundreds of spiritually thirsty and willing youth workers gathered at a missionary compound known for digging deep wells and distributing water to those in great need.  God provided an oasis in the desert land of Haiti this past January, where living water was tasted, spirits filled, and hearts set ablaze.  Hope remains alive in Haiti.  Light continues to shine in dark, desolate, and despairing places as God’s people come to remind those they love that God has not forgotten them.
