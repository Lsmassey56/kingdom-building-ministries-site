**What’s worth remembering: Celebration + Suffering**

Nothing could be more at odds than planning a kingly coronation and a funeral all in the same day, but that’s more or less what happened that first Holy Week Sunday.  It’s a day that’s been named both Palm Sunday and Passion Sunday through the centuries.  Isn’t it peculiar -- palms and passion, peace-donkeys and Pharisees, celebration and suffering?   It wasn’t strange for Jesus.  Joy and pain weren’t so far apart in Jesus’ estimation.  The joy of seeing his “good” and “very good” creation alive and free was well worth the humiliating shame and cost of crucifixion.  Although he may have been the only truly aware at the party, his death was actually worth celebrating in advance. “For the joy set before him, he endured the cross,” Hebrews 12:2 tells us.  Surely the words of the psalm-writer filled Jesus’ soul, “Though the sorrow may last for the night, the joy comes in the morning” (Psalm 30:5).

**Something to ponder today:**
I am a part of “the joy set before him.”  Am I grateful?  How much?  How much is my “passion for Jesus” worth suffering and sacrificing for?  

**Experience it in the Word:**
Matthew 21:1-11 | Mark 11:1-1 | Luke 19:28-44 | John 12:12-16
