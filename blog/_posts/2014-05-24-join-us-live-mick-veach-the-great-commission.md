Mick’s passion is to finish the great commission and to mobilize as many people as possible to engage in this effort. His life verse is Acts 20:24, “However, I consider my life worth nothing to me if only I can finish the race and complete the task the task the Lord Jesus has given me, the task of testifying to the gospel of God’s grace.”
