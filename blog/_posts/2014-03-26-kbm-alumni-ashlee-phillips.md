**Q: Where have you questioned God's intentionality in your life?**

**A:** At this time in my life, I was questioning God being intentional in my life during my sports this year. I finally accomplished making varsity and gained a starting spot. Then, in one of our basketball games in November, I tore my ACL going for a loose ball rebound. I was completely crushed and hurt knowing my season was now over even though it had just begun. I kept asking, “Why now? Why me?”. I questioned God because I just couldn’t believe that this was in the plan.

**Q: Where have you found peace and safety in knowing that you are part of God's greater story?**

**A** During the time of knee surgery and recovery, I found joy, peace and safety knowing God was using this setback in my life to be a part of his greater story. God really open my eyes and heart to Jeremiah 29:11. 
*“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”*

During The Experience, we talked a lot about Jeremiah 29:11. God reminded me that His plans are never to harm me but to help prosper me and to give me hope in the future. 

**Q: How has your life been a display of God's glory?**

My life has been a huge but small display of God’s glory, from the time of my birth to my life now. God’s been getting nothing but the glory. I had such a tough time making it while my ACL was torn, but my teammates and others around saw God moving in me. God got nothing but the glory from this injury and my life. 

>All of life and creation are about the glory of God. 
(1 Chronicles 16:23-32)

"It is not about you and making your story better, but about waking up to the infinitely bigger God story happening all around you. God's invitation to you is to join Him in it. It's about looking up to see that there's a story that has been going on long before you arrived on the planet and one that will go on long after you're gone. God is the central character of this story...He commands center stage in existence, Creation, time, life, history, redemption, and eternity." ~ Lou Giglio
