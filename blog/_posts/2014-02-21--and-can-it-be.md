Below are the lyrics to the third stanza of the hymn ‘And Can It Be’. 
Charles Wesley wrote these words in 1738, yet the truth remains the same. 
What might God want to say to you today through this hymn?


And Can It Be

3. He left his Father's throne above 
(so free, so infinite his grace!), 
emptied himself of all but love, 
and bled for Adam's helpless race. 
'Tis mercy all, immense and free, 
for O my God, it found out me! 
'Tis mercy all, immense and free, 
for O my God, it found out me!
