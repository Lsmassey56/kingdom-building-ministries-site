“I’d rather fight you for something I don’t really want than to take what you give that I need.”
– Rich Mullins, *Hold Me Jesus*

Some latched on to the invitation from Jesus to “come, follow me,” and some did not.  Ever wonder what made the difference in either direction?  Perhaps a little closer to home, what tips the scales in your decision to follow Jesus or to walk away?

Many are astonished when they read the story of how Peter and Andrew, and then, James and John (Matthew 4:18-22), immediately left their nets and families and followed Jesus.  And why shouldn’t they be – leaving one’s job and family for even a short period of time requires some chutzpah. Without diminishing the profundity of that moment to “leave everything” and follow Jesus, perhaps the greatest significance near the lake that day was the disciples’ decision to move toward Jesus, to simply begin.  Jesus’ words, presence, and fast-developing reputation compelled them to want more than they currently knew and possessed, and they were willing to test the limits of just how far Jesus might take them – nationally, politically, religiously, and personally.

While the disciples did indeed leave their nets and father that day, their decision was not irrevocable.  The possibility existed for them to easily return to fishing and family.  That choice was, and is, true for many.  Like the parable of the seeds and the soils addressed to many would-be followers in Matthew 13:1-9, many start out interested in Jesus, but few stay with him beyond the hard and rocky places of life, the chokeholds of comfort and control, and the lies of the Enemy that seduce them to settle for the lethal safety of self-governance.  

While the disciples’ decision to follow Jesus that day that was amazing, more so was their choice to keep following Jesus in the difficult and costly days, months, and years that followed.  When one pursues Jesus, the time comes, whether immediate or gradual, when one has to lose his or her life to find it (Matthew 16:25), to fall to the ground like a kernel of wheat and die (John 12:24), and to take up one’s cross daily and not lead, but follow (Luke 9:23).

In time, one must decide that following Jesus is worth laying everything at his feet: heart, soul, family, control, comfort, geography, career, relationships, possessions, etc.  In the end, one must trust that God is worth seceding to and following.  And when the reality of that decision comes, some, like the rich young ruler, count the cost too high and sadly walk away (Matthew 19:16-26).  But for those who are willing to lay down their crown before Jesus, they find that their “everything” is really nothing at all compared to the “surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus as Lord” (Philippians 3:8).

**Ponder the question once again: What tips the scales in your decision to follow or walk away?**
