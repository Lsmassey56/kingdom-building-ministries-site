“Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.  Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.”
Psalm 37:3-4

Each life that comes through *The Experience* will, at some point during the summer, grapple with the desires in their heart.  And many, before arriving in Colorado, have spent time in prayer asking God to meet them in a specific way.

Have you ever offered a desire of your heart before God?  What happened?

Oftentimes, the story goes like this: “The journey hasn’t gone how I expected and the process is humbling, but God has brought things to pass that were beyond what I could have imagined or hoped for.”

That was the kind of story I heard again and again as a group of alumni from 2012 shared what God had been up to in the past year:

- “God saw my desire to nurture, mother, and use food to bless others, and has opened the door for me to be a full-time nanny!”

- “I can’t believe I’m a second year dental student and pursuing the dream God has given me to spread the gospel through dentistry.”

- “Growing up, I didn’t let myself dream.  But I understand now that God does see my heart and is leading me one step at a time towards a new path.”  

- “A deep desire in my heart was to reach youth, but my insecurities held me back.  During The Experience I found freedom and was filled with overflowing joy to trust God in this journey.  Two years later, after graduating from school, I’ve accepted a youth leader position at a church!”

“*Trust in the Lord* and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.  *Delight yourself in the Lord* and he will give you the desires of your heart.”

Could it be that as we offer ourselves to the Lord, trust Him, and delight in Him, that He will shape our desires to match the vision and purpose of His heart?

**What would you ask of the Lord this summer?  Will you dare to embark on a new journey of faith?**
