Last month, KBM Itinerant Jason Roe and a team of 14 crossed country borders and landed in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.  With hearts excited to serve and spread the light of Christ the team spent a week with *The Micah Project* of Honduras. 

Tegucigalpa is widely known as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world.  Darkness is felt heavily over the city and poverty is a deathly enemy who brings brokenness to many.  Countless young boys and girls roam the streets finding whatever they can to survive, and most end up addicted to sniffing glue as an escape to their reality.  

Yet, this darkness is no match for the light of Christ.  *The Micah Project* is one such organization bringing hope and transformation.  In Tegucigalpa the project has two group homes for young men and boys, an outreach to street children and a variety of other ministries to the neediest people in the city ([www.micahprojecthonduras.org](http://www.micahprojecthonduras.org)).  This was the second year Jason took a team to The Micah Project.  “The boys worked with us, played with us and every ounce of time other than sleeping was spent with the boys building relationships.  It was awesome.”

One year ago the team met Edward, a boy on the streets abandoned and addicted to glue.  The team prayed for him that day and hadn't stopped praying for him all year.  Jason shared with excitement that upon their return, the newest boy added to the home was none other than Edward.  “I’ve been praying for you!” a member of the team said to Edward.  “But you haven’t known me very long, it’s only been a couple days.”  The team member pulled up a picture from his phone from the day they met a year ago to show Edward his own face between him and Jason…the boy was stunned.  There is no doubt the light of Christ is walking into the darkness of the streets.  His light is one that rescues the lost, is warm with relationship, breaks the chains of addiction, and a light that loves.

Jason challenges his team to remember that the same light of Christ they encountered in Honduras is what they have to bring home.  “This is not your Jerusalem,” he says.

Going to “Samaria” or the “ends of the earth” ([Acts 1:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:1-10&version=NIV)) can feel a little more exciting than going next door, but the truth of the laborship we’ve been called to means our mission field is all around - down the street, in the grocery store and at the gym.  What are you doing right now as mission work in “your Jerusalem?”  

Jason’s encouragement to you: Walk with the Lord every moment of every day of every minute of every second!  Laboring is a life journey that we don’t get to check out from; He may have an “Edward” for you to touch.  The Lord may be planning to call you elsewhere, but where you are TODAY is important preparation for where He may call you onward.
