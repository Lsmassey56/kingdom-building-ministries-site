"*Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves … Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus*" (Philippians 2:3, 5).

As we journey onward with hearts that yearn to be more like Jesus Christ, it is valuable to pause once in a while and ask if we are truly surrendered to that aim.  Are there certain characteristics of our Savior we tend to pick and choose from?  Loving, but not sacrificial.  Influential, but not persecuted or misunderstood.  Forgiving, but only if my neighbor admits that he’s wrong.  Could this picking and choosing of our likeness to Jesus Christ be the very problem we label as the hypocrisy that plagues the church and the world’s perspective of Christians?  

"*Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: 
Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.  And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death – even death on a cross!*" (Philippians 2:5-8)

St. Augustine once said, “Humility is the foundation of all the other virtues hence, in the soul in which this virtue does not exist there cannot be any other virtue except in mere appearance.”  If humility is not the foundation of all that we do and offer, our efforts cease to have meaning.  A humble heart and mind is the soil for God’s transformative work and glorious display of His character through you.  

Humility is not low self-esteem.  Humility is not self-pity.  Humility is not humbling ourselves still with the feeling that we are greater than others.  Our humility is false if it in any way involves “me.”  Genuine humility is not thinking of self at all.

**Philippians 2 shows us how Jesus modeled humility:**
- He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped.
*How often do you question God or think you know better?*
- He was a servant who came to serve (Matthew 20:28).
*Are you out to be the King on your kingdom or to serve one greater than your own?*
- He was made in human likeness and was totally dependent on the Father.
*Do you humbly accept that God will provide everything you need through the trials you face?*
- He was obedient…unto suffering and death.
*To what extent is your obedience willing to go to?  Have you been consumed by God’s heart and passionate love for His children?*

Our attitude will continue to grow up in Jesus Christ’s likeness the more our surrender to His work in us matches our desire to be like Him.  But as long as we pick and choose from His characteristics, our love will be stale, our truth unfounded, and our witness dull.
