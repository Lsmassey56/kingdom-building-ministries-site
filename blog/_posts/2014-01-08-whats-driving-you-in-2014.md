With 2013 clearly in the rear view mirror and 2014 fully ahead, what a perfect time to pull over and "take five" to review, reflect, and resolve your Kingdom dwelling life (all cell phones and other listening distractions safely tucked away, please).  

A quick quiz to review 2013: "On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being “you” and 10 being “God,” of course), was your life in 2013 (your time, passion, energy, money, thoughts, goals, dreams) more about “you” (1) or more about God and His Kingdom (10)?"  

With your number firmly in hand, what deeper things of the heart -- beyond a promise to simply change your behavior by doing things like reading your Bible more, serving harder, or attending church more often – will help move you to a deeper, richer, or more meaningful life in tandem with God (10) in 2014?  

Take some time to really listen to God for a moment.  Don’t allow the awkwardness of silence to   distract or dissuade you.  What do you hear God saying, tapping you on the shoulder about, that you will resolve to better do or be over the next several months?  Perhaps allow your lips to finish this simple heart’s prayer, “Lord, what I hear you saying about my life with you is __________?” 

Whatever you’ve heard God sharing with you, share with a close friend or accountability partner, and begin living into your challenge or calling with courage and joy.  After all, it’s God Himself who is beckoning you further and higher, and He’s always faithful to complete the good work He begins.

When ready, return to life’s highway.  And may God take you on the ride of your life in 2014!
