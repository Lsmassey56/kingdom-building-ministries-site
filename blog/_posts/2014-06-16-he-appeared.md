The teams have reached the final week of the international stage!  Pray each team member would boldly follow God's voice, know God's heart more clearly and surrender to God's plan.

*Titus 2:11-13 -- For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope — the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.*

##Team Honduras
**Team Leader, Loren Hayes:** Saturday, we took a walk around downtown and then took public transportation to a friends house from the church.  We had lunch and spent time in worship there - we have some gifted worshippers on this team!  We then took some time to do a little souvenir shopping before having dinner at the Varella home, a special family with ties to Kingdom Building Ministries.  We prayed over them as they are in need of God's provision.  Yesterday we shared in the youth service at church and then headed to the beach.  We anticipate God's continued favor and blessing.  We've met so many great people who have blessed us as brothers and sisters in Christ.  Amen!!

##Team Haiti
**Team Leader, Racher Reed:** Spending time in the Haitian rain forest area has been so good.  We spent Friday morning at an inhabited beach with the Thede family and about 20 Hatian adults and children. It was beautiful, restful and had plenty of time to throw the kids around in the water. During the afternoon, we helped fold laundry and took a tour of the land Corey Thede has developed through his agricultural endeavors. It was amazing to see how he is equipping the Haitians with both food and income through the crops. 

Saturday morning we hiked to the top of a small mountain and John Vermilya and Rainey (friend from Buckley) shared some powerful thoughts and challenges.

God has been faithful and this Haiti experience has been a gift.

Picture below: John Vermilya challenging the team to consider and embrace Jesus alone as the real hope for Haiti.
