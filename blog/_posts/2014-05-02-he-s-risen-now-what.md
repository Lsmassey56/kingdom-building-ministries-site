The first Resurrection Day was a fairly quiet affair.  While many people today still feel the thundering reverberation of “Christ is risen!” echoing deep within their chests, that first Easter came with few fireworks this side of heaven.  While angels were singing, saints dancing, and hall-of-faith inductees whooping and hollering, those living beneath the cloud of eternity moved with a different choreography.  

The disciples were hopeful but a bit fearful.  They cloistered themselves in obscurity trying to make sense of it all.  The women were elated at their open-tomb discovery and risen-Lord garden encounter, but they still went away wondering what it all meant and who would believe what they had witnessed.  And then there were the two men traveling back to their Jerusalem suburb home of Emmaus.  Surprised by Love himself, their hearts were strangely warmed.  Still, only as Jesus began to put the pieces together for them did they recognize him as the risen Lord and run to Jerusalem to tell the others.

In time, long after the initial reports and the inaugural hope-filled murmurings, the reality of Jesus alive forevermore sank deep and spread wide for those who dared to truly believe.

Fast-forward two thousand years.  Where are you in all this?  With this year’s Easter celebration not so distant in the rearview mirror, who is the risen Lord to you?  Is the power of the resurrection, Christ alive in you, spurring you on to share such unbelievably good and true news with others?  Is it helping you face the unknowns of tomorrow and the fears and challenges of today?  Is it giving you reason to rise in the morning and face the day with joy and purpose? 

Here’s a challenge for you and a way to answer the question of what the resurrection means to you.  **Complete this sentence:  “Because Jesus lives, I …”**
