**What’s worth remembering about today: Supreme Love + Finished Work**

Jesus’ seven lasts words that fateful, yet forever good, Friday:

1. “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”  Luke 23:34
2. “Today, you will be with me in paradise.”  Luke 23:43
3. “Dear woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother."  John 19:26-27
4. “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  Matthew 27:46
5. “I am thirsty.” John 19:28
6. “It is finished!”  John 19:30
7. "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."  Luke 23:46

What might be your final words at death?  Will they be words of love and forgiveness?  Will they be utterances of a work completed and a life that’s committed to God?  Will your words convey all that is “good” about Christ’s redemptive work on the Cross? 

**Something to ponder today:**
What in me needs to be crucified with Christ that I may truly live for him in God’s Kingdom?  How grateful am I for Christ’s sacrifice on the Cross for my sin, and how will I thank him?

**Experience it in the Word:**
Mt 27:1-66 | Mk 15:1-47 | Lk 22:66-23:55 | Jn 18:28-19:42
