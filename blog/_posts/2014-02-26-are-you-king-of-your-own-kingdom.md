What compelled Elisha to burn his plow, leave everything he’d worked for and say goodbye to his family to follow Elijah in 1 Kings?  Could it be that he caught a glimpse of a God greater than He could ever fathom and a greater kingdom than his own?  

The same King and Kingdom inspired Paul to write, “I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things” (Philippians 3:8). 

>Is God’s greatness enough for you?  Enough to step down from ruling your own throne and controlling your own kingdom?

Take a look at these questions.
Have you ever:
•	felt angry towards something or someone because things didn’t go your way?
•	chosen your own comfort over God’s call?
•	been disappointed and bitter about not seeing the fruits of your labor?
•	controlled a person or situation because you didn’t trust that God could or would take care of it?
•	agreed to a ministry role because it advanced your standing and fame?

If so, pause and ask, “Whose kingdom was I really serving?  Mine?  Or God’s?” and “Whose kingdom am I currently advancing?  My own?  Or God’s?”

Compared to God’s greatness and the way He cares for us, the kingdoms we build for ourselves look more like slums and shanty towns than the perceived mansions and streets of gold we envision.  The comfort and peace we experience when we feel all is well within “my kingdom” quickly crumbles when life gets “out of control.”  

1 Corinthians 3:11-14 tells us that there is no other foundation to build upon than Jesus Christ.  What we build will be tested by fire one day and shown for whose kingdom it advanced.  Therefore, the fruit of building our own kingdom will prove worthless sooner or later.  Jesus never taught that living life “my way or the highway” would bring us any good.  What he did say was, “Take up your cross and follow me.”  We must follow Him into His Kingdom, the only one that cannot be shaken (Hebrews 12:26-29), and let our own burn away.

After forty years wandering in the desert, Joshua said to the Israelites, “choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve” (Joshua 24:15).  Maybe it’s time we do the same.  Whose kingdom is your life really all about these days?
