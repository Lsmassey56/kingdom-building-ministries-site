*Dangerous: Engaging the People and Places No One Else Will*

>“God has a habit of weaving turning points into our lives, making our spiritual lives full of corners. But he also will lead us to 	>“cliffs” – those in-your-face, bigger-than-life decision moments. Corners often come naturally, and don’t require much thought. Cliffs, on >the other hand, call for risk taking. You want to step over the edge and do something for God, but the fear of the unknown tells you to >keep your feet planted. “
