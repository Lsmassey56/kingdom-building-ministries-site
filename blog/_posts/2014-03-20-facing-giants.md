Locked on opposing hillsides, the two armies hesitated in ceasefire.  Who would make the next move?  How would this clash end?  On one side stood the mammoth of a man, a giant – nearly twice as tall and double the girth of even the largest opposing soldier.  His hand, sized to crush a man’s head like an egg for breakfast, held a sword that surely fatigued the blacksmith in the making.  Fitted in armor that seemed to be more uncomfortable than useful, the giant called out across the ravine, “Let’s get this thing over with.  Put your best man forward.  It’s this simple: He beats me, you win; I beat him, we win.”  His deep voice thundered through the chests of his opposers as he awaited their reply.  

On the other side stood men of ordinary strength and stature, their eyes angled toward their feet for fear their king might mistake even the smallest of glances as a sign to call them forward to the task he himself wanted no part.  Silence filled the camp.  Terrified and half defeated, the army waned as the giant’s taunts rang repeatedly in their restless ears some forty days.  

The king kept recruiting, but not a solitary soldier stepped forward to face the giant.  No, not one man.  But a boy … did.  The smallest and youngest among them, the least likely, the least battle tested – trusted God the most.  And with the unwavering belief of “who is this giant that he should defy the armies of the living God,” the young boy dared to trust God far beyond any fear presenting itself.  He wanted to discover all over again just how big his God really was.  The youngster reasoned, “the Lord saved me from the paw of the lion and bear on more than one occasion, surely he will rescue me here as well.”  And God did.  The boy used what the Lord had provided.  And the sling slung.  And the rock reamed.  And the giant fell.  And far beyond his fears, the boy trusted God to fight the battle at hand that God might be put on display once again.

That’s David’s story.  What’s yours?  What are your eight foot giants?  Who or what frightens you?  Do you trust that the God who has rescued you before will do it all over again despite impossible circumstances?  Are you willing to trust God and see just how big he really is?  David battled one fear or another his entire life.  But David, called “a man after God’s own heart,” also learned at an early age what the apostle John wrote about centuries later – that “perfect love casts out fear” (I John 4:18), and that the closer we draw to the heart of God, the better we hear and trust God when he says, “do not be afraid, I am with you … always.”
