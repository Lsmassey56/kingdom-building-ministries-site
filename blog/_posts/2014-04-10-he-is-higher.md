>“As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways
and my thoughts than your thoughts” (Isaiah 55:9).

In the beginning of Isaiah 55, God extends a beautiful invitation to His thirsty people to simply come and be satisfied in all that He has for them. This invitation also comes with a warning of sorts. God says, “My ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.” 

Recently, I have had several conversations with friends where we discussed how it seems our plans never go according to what we anticipate. We plan and have expectations, yet so often reality looks a lot (or maybe just a little) different from what we anticipated or hoped for. 

However, as we reflect on our life, can we admit that we are glad that we aren’t the ones calling all the shots? Can we turn our hearts to our God who is bigger and beyond our ways and thoughts and is so faithful to make this life about more than what we can conceive in our own minds? To receive God’s invitation to come is also an invitation to surrender our lives to a Kingdom that is not our own and to give our lives to a call and purpose that is about more. 
Whether we encounter times of great joy or intense struggle, will we surrender to the God who is all-present and all-knowing, and receive the invitation to come to Him in humility, with open hands and hearts? 


*Humility is perfect quietness of heart. It is to expect nothing, to wonder at nothing that is done to me, to feel nothing done against me. It is to be at rest when nobody praises me, and when I am blamed or despised. It is to have a blessed home in the Lord, where I can go in and shut the door, and kneel to my Father in secret, and am at peace as in a deep sea of calmness, when all around and above is trouble.*
