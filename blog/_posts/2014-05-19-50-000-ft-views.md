The suitcases picked up from baggage claim just a few days ago now rest empty as the students who carried them to Colorado settle into their new "summer home." Driving from the airport, the reality of the impending experiences produces a variety of emotions and physical reactions from the students -- excitement, fear, anticipation, anxiety, and a hint of "what have I gotten myself into!" The view from the car window on their ride to the Kingdom Building Ministries campus provides an incredible scene of the Rocky Mountains that follow to the West.  The picturesque mountain vistas remain in clear view from the main KBM conference room as a constant reminder of the greatness and glory of God. It's a view that never gets old. Every glance and glimpse of "purple mountain majesty" brings new perspective.
 
One of the over-riding themes that The Experience team grapples with this first week of teaching and interactive learning is about "perspective."  The mountains lay a natural backdrop to get up high and see things as they really are below.  Rising above the "business as usual" views of our lives to see things a little closer to how God sees them is always beneficial. It's a practice that is pertinent to all of us, no matter where this email ends up geographically.

Our view of God and life at lower levels of focus (like a runway view out of an airplane window or perhaps in flight at 10,000 or 20,000 feet) keeps our eyes on the minute and mundane details of life.  Not that tasks, projects, and everyday roles and responsibilities don't matter (because the reality of life necessitates that they do), but most people rarely live and make decisions beyond these levels. Try as we might, the 10,000 and 20,000 ft. levels of perspective are often filled with obstacles, noise, and distractions that prevent us from seeing God's vision and purpose with clarity.

As we cooperate with God in raising our gaze to His higher levels of sight and insight (more like a 50,000 ft. view of things), our perspective drastically changes.  God's vision and His purposes become clearer, and all other lesser details of life begin to take shape and meaningful function. Obstacles and circumstances that once seemed so big suddenly seem so much smaller. Walls and barriers that once obstructed us from seeing God's best now can be more easily navigated. From God's 50,000 ft. vantage point, sight-line unhampered, our lives begin to move and respond to the impulses of God's love with great clarity.

Yes, The Experience students on this summer's adventure with Jesus are learning about perspective.  They are being challenged to see things not just from another point of view, but a 50,000 ft. God-view that rises high above the obstacles and low-level vistas and values of our lives.  The mountains here provide that beautiful reminder to the team. 

**May God provide you with a 50,000 ft. vantage point to see His world, your life, and His ways and love as they really are, so that every facet and realm of your living unites glorify His name.**
