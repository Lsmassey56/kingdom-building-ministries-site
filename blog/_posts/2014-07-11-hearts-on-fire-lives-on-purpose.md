*After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. Revelation 7:9*

Students spent their final morning of The Experience in a time of worship and scripture reading in English, Czech, Russian and Massai.  It was glorious.    

You might have expected the room to be bursting with noise and energy, to see faces confident in all they accomplished this summer, envisioning each life being clear of the purpose ahead...but the scene this morning was different.  For fire doesn't have to be loud, and true purpose doesn't demand to be noticed.  The humble expressions filling the room were ones that recognized that the transformation, gifts, grace, goodness and love God has extended to them this summer were beyond what they could have hoped for and even beyond what their minds can comprehend the meaning of.  While standing with hands raised, I imagine that mouths sang some of the only words they could find, "Father, thank you for all you've done."  And eyes were fixed on their Rock, expressing geniune need for Jesus to walk with them onward.

The way of the Kingdom of God is contrary to the wisdom of this world: the meek and humble are blessed, the ordinary and weak are made extraordinary and strong, followers are led by the Spirit of God himself, and its mysterious movement will always go unmeasured as one heart on fire sets another heart ablaze, who ignites another.

As you look upon each student, don't misunderstand, for fire doesn't need to be loud  and true purpose won't demand to be noticed.  Their hearts are indeed on fire for God, His Spirit lives inside - unstoppable, light-bearing, transforming and refining. And their life purpose has found its highest calling - to know God, to love and be loved by Him, and to labor tirelessly for the advancement of God's Kingdom.

*You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. Instead of the thornbush will grow the juniper, and instead of briers the myrtle will grow.
This will be for the Lordâ€™s renown, for an everlasting sign, that will endure forever. Isaiah 55:12-13*
