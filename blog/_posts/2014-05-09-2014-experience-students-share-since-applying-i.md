Although the Experience *officially* begins May 16th, the faith-journey begins the day each student submits their application.  As they prepare for the summer and engage the fundraising process, we pray that God would deepen their relationship with Him before they even set foot inside our doors!  Two incoming students, Devin and Bethany, have shared what God has been showing them while preparing for the summer ahead.

**Q: Describe what your journey has been like since applying for the Experience.**

**A:** *The Experience* started once I turned my application in.  I knew there was no way I could meet my fundraising goal all on my own!  Never before have I had to rely on the Body for encouragement and support like this, and the ways God provided blew my mind!  I've learned so much by leaning on God and walking in faith.  I know that God is going to change me this summer, and for the rest of my life I can have faith that wherever God may lead me, He will provide!

**Q: What impact has learning to be more dependent on God made in your life?**

**A:** I’ve realized that from the time I wake up and from the time I go to bed God is present.  God's fingerprints are all over my everyday interactions; He is constantly shaping me and preparing me for what He has in store.  Knowing God is truly with me has instilled a deeper desire to please Him and glorify Him.

**Q: If you dared to believe for something only God could do this summer, what would you ask of Him?**

**A:**  I hope that God can show me who I am, and I hope to gain more understanding about how to use the passions and abilities He's placed inside of me for His Kingdom.

**Q: Has faith taken a new meaning in your life since applying for the Experience?**

**A:** Yes definitely.  Every step I took in the process scared me on some level and I thought, "Okay, I don't know if this will work, but I will do it."  I worried that people wouldn’t respond or want to help.  I felt like God was asking me to just have a willing attitude, to plan and to obey quickly when opportunities rose up.  When I responded to those opportunities God blessed it ways beyond what I hoped for.

**Q: What have you learned during the support raising process (about yourself, about God, and about how He uses others).**

**A:** Fundraising was humbling.  Asking people for help is hard especially when I can’t really repay them. So there was some pride issues to deal with.  I feel like God wanted to show me more of his character through the fundraising process, and that I shouldn’t ask to just “scrape by” with my support.  He likes giving and He wanted to show me love through it.  A lot of people in my life wanted to get involved and help and I learned to how enjoy it because it’s a gift.

**Q: How do you hope God will meet you this summer?**

**A:** I want to see more of His heart and experience more of His love.  It sounds corny but I want to be blown away by it.  I hope He will address and heal some of the fears and insecurities I have.
