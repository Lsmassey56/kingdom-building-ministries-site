Although the Experience *officially* begins May 16th, the faith-journey begins the day each student submits their application.  As they prepare for the summer and engage the fundraising process, we pray that God would deepen their relationship with Him before they even set foot inside our doors!  Two incoming students, Devin and Bethany, have shared what God has been showing them while preparing for the summer ahead.

**Q: Describe what your journey has been like since hearing about the Experience.**

**A:** I learned about the Experience while Dwight Robertson was at my school, Bethel College.  I just knew it was something I was supposed to do.  Even though I didn’t have much time to raise the funds, I had faith that God would provide if He wanted me to come.  I prayed, “If this is all provided for – I know it is completely you, God.”

The trip started when I turned in my application – not May 16th!  I’ve never had to rely on the Body like this to encourage and support me.  I’ve been on missions trips before, but the amount I had to raise wasn’t so significant that I couldn’t do it on my own.  But with the Experience, there was no way I could do it all on my own!  The ways God provided blew my mind – everyone (even people I didn't know) was a part of what God was doing in me.  The process has brought me a lot closer to Him and I’ve experienced Him in ways I never have before.  It’s been awesome to be put into a position to lean on God and walk completely in faith. 

I am completely confident that God is going to shape me and change me this summer because I KNOW that God wants me here.  And for the rest of my life, I can have faith that God is going to provide for me wherever He wants to take me!

**Q: What impact has learning to be more dependent on God made in your life?**

**A:** I’m more mindful of God throughout my day…realizing that from the time that I wake from the time I go to bed, He is present and beside me, and is constantly shaping me and preparing me for what He wants to do.  His fingerprints are all over my everyday interactions.  I’ve become more intentional about everyone I’m with and everything I do – since I know God is present with me I want to be glorifying to Him all the time.  It’s instilled in me a deeper desire to please Him and glorify Him because He’s present!

**Q: If you dared to believe for something only God could do this summer, what would you ask of Him?**

**A:** I hope that God can show me who I am…I hope to understand more about how God has designed me to serve His Kingdom with the passions and abilities He’s placed inside of me.  I want to know what it will look like when my identity is finally found in Him!

**Q: Has faith taken a new meaning in your life since applying for the Experience?**

**A:** Yes definitely.  Every step I took in the process scared me on some level and I thought, "Okay, I don't know if this will work, but I will do it."  I worried that people wouldn’t respond or want to help.  I felt like God was asking me to just have a willing attitude, to plan and to obey quickly when opportunities rose up.  When I responded to those opportunities God blessed it ways beyond what I hoped for. 

**Q: What have you learned during the support raising process (about yourself, about God, and about how He uses others).**

**A:** Fundraising was humbling.  Asking people for help is hard especially when I can’t really repay them. So there was some pride issues to deal with.  I feel like God wanted to show me more of his character through the fundraising process, and that I shouldn’t ask to just “scrape by” with my support.  He likes giving and He wanted to show me love through it.  A lot of people in my life wanted to get involved and help and I learned to how enjoy it because it’s a gift. 

**Q: How do you hope God will meet you this summer?**

**A:** I want to see more of His heart and experience more of His love.  It sounds corny but I want to be blown away by it.  I hope He will address and heal some of the fears and insecurities I have.
