*So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up on Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD. And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.*  Exodus 34:4-7

It’s not often in scripture that we encounter God telling us who He is. But in this sacred moment, after Moses had just encountered the Israelites worshipping a golden idol (once again losing their way, compass, and making a general mess of things), he came up the mountain, a second time, to receive the law of God, and God stands with him and proclaims Himself. 

Who is God? Compassionate. Gracious. Slow to anger. Abounding in love and faithfulness. Maintaining love to thousands. Forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. 

In <a href="http://www.kbm.org/speakers/robert-gelinas/" target="_blank">Robert Gelinas’</a> book, <a href="http://mercyprayerbook.com" target="_blank">The Mercy Prayer</a>, he suggests that to pray, “Lord have mercy” is nothing short of a request for the fullness of God’s character to make itself known in our present situation. It is an acknowledgement of our own depravity and helplessness apart from the very essence of YHWH being among us. 

Where do you need to see God’s compassion? Where do you need to encounter abundant love and faithfulness? Where may God’s forgiveness enter in and transform? Ask. Ask that God, in his mercy, would invade your realities and that his very presence would do what no one and nothing else can. 

Lord, have mercy.
