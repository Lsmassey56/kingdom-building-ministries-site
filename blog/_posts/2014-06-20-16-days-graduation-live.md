Welcome to the Live Streaming of 16 Days Graduation!

Thank you for joining us and for believing in the amazing plans God has in store for each of these students.  We take great joy in commissioning them as kingdom laborers today, sent to co-labor in God's mighty plan to love and reach the world.

*Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, â€œThe harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.â€  Matthew 9:35-38*
