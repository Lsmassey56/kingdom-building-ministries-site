Welcome to the Live Streaming of 16 Days Graduation!  The Parents' Reception will begin at 9:00am MST and Graduation will begin at 10:30am MST.

Thank you for joining us and for celebrating the transformational work God has done in the lives of these students.  We take great joy in commissioning them as kingdom laborers today and in sending them out to co-labor with God in His glorious plan to love and reach the world.

*Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."¬ù Matthew 9:35-38*
