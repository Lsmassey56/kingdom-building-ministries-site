The Experience team did some hiking recently.  We'll certainly do some more.  Colorado, hiking, and spiritual journey just seem to go together that way.  Our first jaunt into the mountains proved breathtaking, quite literally.  Colorado Rocky Mountain highs are majestic but hiking in the higher elevations of Colorado isn't exactly a walk in the park.  Hiking here claims one's breathe much more quickly.  Oxygen depleted, muscles begin to burn and send anonymous notes to the brain that seem to say, "Hey, think you might want to slow down a bit or perhaps even sit a spell?"  The steep Rocky Mountain trails can outmuscle the strongest of hikers.  It certainly did several of us Rocky Mountain rookies!

Our lack of hiking prowess, however, didn't matter much that day.  After all, our leisurely trek wasn't a race -- we were there for other purposes.  But that was not the case for the more serious guests on the south face of that over-sized hill that day.  Men and women 20, 30, even 40 years our senior were not just hiking efficiently, they were all-out sprinting both up and down the steep incline!  Many of us, breath taken and muscles exhausted, watched in amazement these seasoned athletes of Olympic caliber (at least in our minds!) traverse the mountainside with seeming ease.

Certainly their muscles ached.  Surely the years of training brought numerous occasions in all kinds of weather conditions for their bodies to be broken down only to be made stronger, faster, and better conditioned.  There was pain, but there was also great gain.

Many of us on The Experience team that day could not help but connect the dots to our own journey with Jesus.  In seeing God more clearly from a higher, 50,000 ft. view, like the prophet Isaiah, we began to see things in our lives - for better and worse - with greater clarity.  Such verses as "For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it" (Luke 9:24) and "He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful" (John 15:12) came quickly to mind.  The understanding of the addition of Christ by the subtraction of our own self-sufficiency became clearer that day. The truth of "less of us for more of Christ" ran so deep for many of our students that day that they later turned to another verse and expression: "Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed" (James 5:16), and many of our students laid down some sin, weight, and burdens that have been keeping them (some, for quite awhile) from running strong and free with Jesus.  Seeing God "high and lifted up," leads us to a sharper vision of our "unclean lips" (Isaiah 6) and the hurt and brokenness all around us.

**As you traverse your daily mountainsides are there things in your life that need to die that Christ might truly live in and through you?  When was the last time you saw God for more of who He really is and had a “woe!” moment in your life?**
