What does rest look like? For some, it is reading or listening to music. For others, it's actually a long walk or run. Maybe sleeping, artwork, hiking, cooking, cleaning, organizing. Just being.
 
We often wrestle with just being, with resting. So much noise clamors for our attention constantly. So many demands dictate our schedules.
 
But God offers a better, more hopeful and whole, word for us: the gift of Sabbath. In our culture, we've lost the art of Sabbath days. Too many times, it centers around a singular day of the week (Sunday, or maybe Saturday), and it is often condensed to the time frame called "church." We spend time in worship, go to lunch, then jump back into the grind of lists and such. Again, there surely is a better way.
 
This past week, we spent some time exploring the beauty of God's gift to us in Sabbath. Jesus tells us in Mark 2 that the Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people, not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath. Martha Zimmerman says, "When balanced, our activities during the week become preparation time for the Sabbath, somewhat like a path leading us to the gate of a garden. Sabbath was a gift of time in which to put things into order and allow God to be God in our lives. It can become a time for us to rediscover places inside of ourselves that are forgotten during the rest of the busy week."
 
We are encouraged by God to live into the gift of really resting, for our wholeness and for our peace. Maybe Sabbath doesn't look like what we've made it, and maybe it can be a precious treasure. Perhaps thatâ€™s what God had in mind.   
 
**Whatever form your "rest" takes on, may you know to the fullest extent what it means that "a person is a person" on the Sabbath.**
