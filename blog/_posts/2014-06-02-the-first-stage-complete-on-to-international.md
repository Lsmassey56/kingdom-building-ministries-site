Sunday night marked the end of the first stage of The Experience, and we marked the transition into the second stage with an amazing night of praise, worship, and prayer.  Three student teams fly to three international locations (Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras) this week, and we could not send them without first preparing through prayer.  We closed the night with a special time of anointing the students with oil as a symbol that they have been appointed and chosen by God to labor for His Kingdom.  The students have been so faithful to soak up teaching upon teaching during the first stage, and now by God's grace, they get to experience living it out day by day!

This upcoming week, would you pray specifically for students to:
- Take in their new surroundings quickly and let the Lord speak to their hearts about His plan for the country they are in
- Be willing vessels of the Lord's compassion, mercy, and love 
- Have a posture of humility to learn and be stretched by new experiences
- Grow as a team through greater trust and vulnerability

*The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.  He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.
Isaiah 60:1*

*“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!” Mark 1:15*
