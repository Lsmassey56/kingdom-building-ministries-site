Rebecca Crim is a 2006 KBM alumni of the young adult TLI program. She currently lives in Indiana and works as an elementary music teacher. 
Below are some of her thoughts around the idea of Epiphany, the manifestation of Christ among us. 

**Q: Where has Jesus shown up in unexpected places for you?**

**A:** I see Jesus in the younger students I work with. They’ll say something about God or another student that clicks in my mind and helps me see God in new, yet simple ways.

It’s also in the little things. The other day had been a long day at work. I was coming home and there was randomly a good spot in front of my apartment. In little things like that, I thank God. That might seem silly, but I do see God is present with us even in the small and quick moments. 

**Q: What reminds you to be the manifestation of Christ to those around you?**

**A:** I often hear stories of kids from rough homes and backgrounds. As a teacher I can do all we can at work, but there’s not a lot I can do to change their situation, other than pray and bring that child and family before God. I will be the light I can be while they are with me in the classroom, and then continue to cover them through my prayers. It’s in hearing these tough stories, that I am reminded of my role in being part of the kingdom and being a follower of Christ. 

There is a particular person who is a good example to me of Christ’s love to people. He is a teacher who pours out love to the students he’s talking to. 
He runs and after school Bible club, but also takes advantage of classroom time. He and his family take families and students under their wing and reached out to people in the community to help them in any way they can. They don’t have a lot of money, but know that they’re still called to be the hands and feet of Christ. 


**Q: How has the manifestation of the present and alive Christ been a reality in your own life?**

**A:** By remembering who I am in Christ. Remembering what the truth of God says in Scripture. It’s what I was taught at KBM and that has always stuck with me - my identity is a child of God and I don’t have to be anything else. So when my foundation gets shifted, this is what I come back to. The idea of “I am his and he loves me” is always what I cling to. 

There was a time last year where I was having a low day. I remember thinking that I just needed God to hold me. I curled up on my couch, with tears in my eyes, and fell asleep. Even though it sounds weird, I felt like I was being held in the Father’s arms…and that’s the only way I can describe it. I remember waking up, feeling as though I had been embraced. 


>1 John 1:3 

>See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called the children of God! And that is what we are!

**Q: How would you challenge people to be the manifestation of Christ?** 

**A:** Be a ready laborer wherever God has you. 
Recently, I was driving home from the store and along the side of the road there was a guy walking in the cold, with just a sweatshirt and no gloves. I don’t do this often, but I felt like I needed to offer him a ride. He didn’t end up needing a ride, as he was already where he needed to be. But the idea of begin available to what God is prompting your heart to do, is so important. I felt like I was supposed to do it, so I just did it. 

God among us isn't just when people are nice to us, or when something great happens, or you hear the perfect song on the radio, or there's a great parking spot after a long day of work.  I think that might be part of it, but its also in the faces of all the people I see everyday.  My co-workers and my students are Imago Dei.  So when I'm looking in to the face of a student who's getting on my nerves, that face was made in the image of God.  When I'm looking at a co-worker who frustrates me, I'm looking at someone who is deeply loved by my Heavenly Father.  The same God who created and loves me deeper than I'll ever know also created them and loves them just as deep.  All too often I forget this, and I miss an opportunity to see and love "God with us".
