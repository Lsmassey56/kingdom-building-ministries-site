Rebecca Crim is a 2006 KBM alumni of the young adult TLI discipleship training program. She currently lives in Indiana and works as an elementary music teacher. She shared with us some of her thoughts and experiences around the idea of Epiphany, the manifestation of Christ among us...

**Q: Where have you seen Jesus show up in unexpected places?**

**A:** I see Jesus in the younger students I work with. They’ll say something about God or another student that clicks in my mind and helps me see God in new, yet simple ways.

It’s also in the little things – like when I had a long day at work, and suddenly out of nowhere, a more than rare good parking spot greets me as I turn into my apartment complex. In little things like that, I thank God. That might seem silly, but I choose to see God present with us even in the small and quick moments.

**Q: What reminds you to be the manifestation of Christ to those around you?**

**A:** I often hear stories of kids from rough homes and backgrounds. As a teacher, I often feel like there's not a lot I can do to change their situation. I will be the light I can be while they are with me in the classroom, and then bring that child and their family before God in my prayers. When I hear these tough stories, I am reminded of my role in the Kingdom and being a follower of Christ, as one called to push back darkness wherever and whenever I encounter it with the love and light of Christ.

There is also particular person who has been a good example to me of Christ’s love to people. He is a teacher who tries to be an example of Jesus to his students both in the classroom and also through an after school Bible club. He and his family minister to families and students by taking them under their wing and helping them in any way they can. They don’t have a lot of money, but know that they’re still called to be the hands and feet of Christ. It’s not rocket science, he just does his part wherever God places him.

**Q: How have you encountered "God with you" in your own life?**

**A:** There was a time last year where I was having a low day. I remember thinking that I just needed God to hold me. I curled up on my couch, with tears in my eyes, and fell asleep. Even though it sounds weird, I felt like I was being held in the Father’s arms…and that’s the only way I can describe it. I remember waking up, feeling as though I had been embraced.

During my time at KBM, I was taught something that has always stuck with me - my identity is in being a child of God and I don’t have to be anything else. So when my foundation gets shifted, this is what I come back to. The idea of “I am his and he loves me” is always what I cling to.

1 John 1:3
See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called the children of God! And that is what we are!


**Q: How would you challenge people to be the manifestation of Christ?**

**A:** Be a ready laborer wherever God has you. Recently, I was driving home from the store and along the side of the road there was a guy walking in the cold, only wearing a sweatshirt and didn't have any gloves. I don’t do this often, but I felt like I needed to offer him a ride. While he He didn’t end up needing a ride, being available to what God is prompting my heart to do is so important for my faith development. It felt so good to hear God speak and follow through.  

God "among us" isn't just when people are nice to us, when something great happens, you hear the perfect song on the radio, or there's a great parking spot after a long day of work. I think that might be part of it, but it's also in the faces of all the people I see everyday.  My co-workers and my students are made in the image of God, “Imago Dei.”  So when I'm looking in to the face of a student who's getting on my nerves, I need to remember that’s God’s face. When I'm looking at a co-worker who frustrates me, I'm looking at someone who is deeply loved by our Heavenly Father. The same God who created and loves me, who cradles me in His lap, loves that person in front of me to the same extent.  I’m praying that I continue to remember this and that I, along with other co-laborers, won’t miss opportunities to see and love those around us, and become vessels of "God with us."
