Welcome to the Live Streaming of *The Experience* Graduation!  The Parents Reception, with Kingdom Building Ministries President and Founder Dwight Robertson, will begin at 12:30pm MST, with the Graduation Ceremony to follow at 2:00pm MST.

We hope you are blessed by the reminder that God will always be on the move transforming hearts and lives for the glory of His Name and the advancement of His Kingdom!  We give Him all of the praise for the life-change that has occurred this summer.
