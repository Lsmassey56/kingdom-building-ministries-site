**What’s worth remembering about today: Waiting + Wondering**

Try as we might, we will never be able to fully appreciate the feelings of emptiness and loss the first followers of Jesus felt that first day after his crucifixion.  As grief set in, certainly the questions surfaced: What in the world just happened here?  Is this really over?  Is he really gone?  Wasn’t it supposed to end differently than this?  Now what do I do?  And on and on the questions, confusion, and grief flowed.

Amazingly, amidst death’s darkness shined a ray of faith and hope.  The Scriptures tell us that the women, after seeing Jesus’ gravesite, “went home and prepared spices and perfumes.  But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment” (Luke 23:55-56).  Do you see it?  The women went on trusting, obeying, and serving God despite their uncertainty, sorrow, and pain.  As difficult as this whole ordeal had been, they “rested” in the hope that God’s perspective and plan remained far beyond their limited scope.  They believed that, in time, God would do the right thing, the loving thing, and see them through.  

**Something to ponder today:**

Am I resting in hopeful anticipation of the resurrected Lord despite how I feel about it on any given day?  Am I preparing myself to joyfully celebrate the risen Lord tomorrow?

**Experience it in the Word:**

Luke 23:55-66
