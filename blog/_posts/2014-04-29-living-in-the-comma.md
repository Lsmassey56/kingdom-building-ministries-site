An Excerpt from “Baton Passing Relationships”:
>*Many people focus their lives on a singular endpoint, just like a period at the end of a sentence. [But] The way to make a mark is to live in the comma. … People who live in the comma pass the baton to others, just like Abraham passed the baton to Isaac or like Mary passed the baton to Jesus.  They intentionally look for people who they can bless, encourage, or equip.*

One of our initial blog posts this year highlighted Dwight Robertson’s book, *You are God’s Plan A*, which asked you to take a look at the year ahead and consider what God might have in store.  Click <a href="http://www.kbm.org/blog/2014/01/31/living-the-plan-a-life/" target="_blank">here</a> to refer back to the article.

Is your relationship with God continuing to deepen?  Is your love for the people around you growing?  Has God placed someone in your life He’d like you to disciple and “pass the baton” to?

If you’re looking for a next-step resource after reading, *You are God's Plan A*, take a look at <a href="http://kbm.donorshops.com/product/KBM0004/batonpassingbooklet.php" target="_blank">Baton Passing Relationships</a> by Dwight Robertson.  In this book, you'll find helpful encouragement on how to pass on to others what God has already poured into you!  These baton-passing relationships are a prime channel for God to work through you to multiply laborers for His kingdom!
