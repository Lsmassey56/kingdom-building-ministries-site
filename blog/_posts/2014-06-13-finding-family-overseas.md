##Team Haiti
12 The team's time in Cap Haitien was amazing. There were cultural and language barriers to engage, but an evening night of worship in five different languages broke through in an amazing way and the two teams came together and said goodbye feeling the loss of new family.  The time there was filled with teachings, life stories, worship sessions, listening prayer over the city, street evangelism, a prison visit and team building activities. 
>God was so good and gave us a taste of his kingdom on earth with people of all languages. (Team Leader, Rachel Reed)

Yesterday the team traveled to Fauche to join missionary family Corey and Kris Thede with their kids Eli (16) and and Ana (13). They are in north Haiti in what is a rain forest setting, seeing the beauty of this country.  Last night the team heard the story of a kingdom-minded family who has been in Haiti for 15 years.  Today team Haiti is at the beach hoping to build relationships with those they meet.

##Team Honduras
Wednesday, the team sadly said goodbye to their wonderful host, Marcia, and the town of Copan.  They spent about 8 hours on the road and arrived safely in Tegucigalpa.  Upon arrival in the city, they worshipped and asked God to lead the time they will spend ministrering in Tegucigalpa. 

Yesterday team TBTB took on Teguicgapla full force! They started off meeting Alfredo, a youth pastor in the city. Alfredo and some of his team showed them around Tegucigalpa, explaining the historical context of the city. The team was blessed to learn more about the city they are serving in.  Also, the team was given the opportunity to shout their God-given, new names, high above the city!  The night ended with their host Eduardo and his adopted son Juaquin sharing their testimonies. 
>We were so blessed by the way their life stories proclaim God's faithfulness. (Team Leader, Gabby Engle)

##Team Dominican Republic
After returning from Majaguita the team is diving into relationship building with the CMA students. Last night (Thursday) the team hosted their second "youth night" where Mikey and Branson shared part of their testimonies which centered on the theme of "lukewarm living". Then the guys and girls broke up into small groups to discuss and share. The CMA students are asking lots of questions and relationships are going deep pretty quickly. Praise God!  
>We are excited to watch God continue to work as we follow his lead. (Team Leader, Nate Hoot)

This morning their CMA group host, Melisa who is a Honduran national, introduced the team to her adopted Dominican family who lives in a very unique village called El Callejon. The village consists of a rebuilt community whose homes were completely wiped out by a hurricane 40 years ago. The CMA staff and students have adopted this village and helped them to establish a school and educational facilities. After witnessing dinner being prepared (a Dominican chicken butchering experience!), the team was given great perspective on the needs in the Dominican for education and spiritual development. It was amazing for the team to see how indigenous leadership in the village are being empowered to carry the baton and initiate change.

Today the team said goodbye to our itinerant photographer, Jon Stegenga. He is now on his way back to Denver to capture what God is doing among the 16 Days high school team! See you soon, Jon!  Thank you for the amazing photos you've taken!

Don't miss these pictures from the team's time in the village of Majaguita.  Please pray for the team as they continue to build relationships with the students at Carribean Mountain Academy.  May God's love be known and proclaimed - His perfect love that casts out all fear.

*As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Isaiah 55:10-11*
