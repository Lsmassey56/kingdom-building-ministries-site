We praise God for His goodness when skies are blue and the sun is shining, but what happens to our belief when a storm comes to shake any shelter the world could offer?  

James the apostle would encourage us to recall the right perspective – a perspective that believes God is our good Father in heaven who provides the grace we need to be more like Him.  Any trial we experience is an opportunity for our faith to be refined into gold, for godly wisdom and maturity to grow, and for our lives to bear a compelling witness to the world as Jesus Christ helps us overcome.  

Watch this video of a young mother named Stacey.  Through submitting her pain and loss to God and receiving the provision of His goodness, she can now say, 

“God is all that I need, I don’t have to look elsewhere.”

What obstacles in your life stand in the way of telling God, “All I need is you”?

"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.  Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything…Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him" (James 1:2-4, 12).
