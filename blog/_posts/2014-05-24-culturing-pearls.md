Who are we that He is mindful of us?  And yet, God -- the Almighty, the Creator, the real and true God -- condescends that our stories can be shaped, polished, ground down, even, to become something of indescribable artistry and infinite worth.

The Experience students have spent the last several days in the classroom discovering God's story and their own stories within His greater narrative.  They are learning to see their stories in the reality of the Holy Spirit's leading and in the light of His Word.  Some of that learning has been a joyful discovery.  Other lessons have come with some uprooting and tougher tilling.  All of it has been an opportunity to lean on and into Jesus in a deeper way.

Rounded and smooth pearls, the cultured variety that we see in fine jewelry stores everywhere, come about with a bit of human intervention.  The naturally formed ones vary in shape, size, and color.  It's quite interesting that, in either method, the final product is a result of a wound, such as when a foreign irritant or a parasite enters the mantle.  The mollusk creates a sac to seal off the wound, and the creature forms a pearl as a part of the healing process.  This information brings a whole new meaning to "a pearl of great price."

Peppered with irritants, wounds, and parasites, our own stories bear forth varied shapes and colors.  Quirky pearls, we are.  Rare, valuable, iridescent, dazzling, multi-layered, costly.  As a part of the healing process of the wounds we know intimately, words of a transcendent story redefine us as singular fine pearls and then string us together into a collective strand of inestimable grace. 

"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.  When he found the one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it."  Matthew 13:45-46

**The Experience students, in many ways of God's own choosing, are being refined, cultured, into pearls of great price and beauty. How are you being shaped these days?**
