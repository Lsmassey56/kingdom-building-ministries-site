Deep Camp rests snuggly atop a Rocky Mountain plain 9,000 ft. above sea level.  The majesty of the mountains, the keen perspective from new sightlines, the cool water streams and fresh air breezes that often awaken the senses, all add to the Deep Camp experience.  But the deepening that occurs at Deep Camp doesn’t come from the hills.  While the mountains are indeed breathtaking and beautiful, they only serve to provide a backdrop for God to paint magnificent works of love, grace, and purpose on the hearts of those who gather to meet him.  God always has, and always will, make all things beautiful.

While the mountain setting is glorious, let’s be quite clear -- it is God himself who has been transforming the lives of the 250+ people, young to young-at-heart, this week.  

Through a variety of tones, textures, and touches from the Master’s hand, God has been creatively bringing life and color to those who came to meet him.  Some have been met through vibrant and heartfelt worship; others through the powerful challenges of our itinerant speakers; still others through small group interaction, quiet rest, re-engagement with family, and time alone with God.

God remains faithful.  Tomorrow, many will descend the mountain and return to their ordinary, everyday places of work and living across the United States and several countries beyond, as Kingdom laborers living with greater freedom, more intentionality, a clearer identity, and deeper roots to better love God and others.

Sometimes going deeper means going higher.  At least raising our gaze to the hills this past week has sure helped us to discover that our help indeed comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth (Psalm 121).  Resting in that promise, many have experienced what one hymn writer could only describe as “the deep, deep, love of Jesus.”  Thanks be to the maker of the mountains who brings deep transformation in those who lift their eyes to him.
