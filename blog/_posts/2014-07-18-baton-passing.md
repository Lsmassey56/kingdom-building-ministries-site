Are you pouring out what has been poured into you?

One core theme exemplified throughout scripture is something we like to call spiritual multiplication, and spiritual multiplication happens through "baton passing"!  God's Kingdom grows and spreads by faithful laborers committed to passing the baton of spiritual wealth God has freely given them onto others, who will then pass their baton to more, and so on, and so on.  If the body of Christ were fully committed to these types of baton-passing relationships, spurring one another onward towards walking with Jesus, we would see our communities, churches and world transformed!  God designed us to rely on Him and the community of believers we're surrounded by to learn how to walk in His ways, to be transformed into His image and likeness and to become His disciples.  We are mistaken to believe that disciples of Jesus are simply born over night.     

Who do you know in your life right now that would benefit from being pointed towards Jesus Christ and from hearing what God has shown you recently?

A helpful resource we would like to pass on to you is a booklet entitled *Baton Passing Relationships*.  In it, author Dwight Robertson shows you how you can be a great "Kingdom relay team member" today...right now - by encouraging, empowering, and equipping you to pass what God has already poured into your life.  This booklet will provide a solid foundation enabling you to begin living a life of successful spiritual multiplication.

*Baton Passing Relationships* is available online through <a href="http://kbm.donorshops.com/product/KBM0004/batonpassingbooklet.php" target="_blank">kbm.org/store</a>.

*Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.  Ephesians 4:14-16*
