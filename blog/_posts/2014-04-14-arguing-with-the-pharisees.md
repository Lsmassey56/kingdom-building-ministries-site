**What’s worth remembering : God + Boxes**

“Anger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up,” Mahatma Gandhi once said.  The Scribes, Pharisees, and Sadducees of Jesus’ day would have to agree.  As self-proclaimed guardians of God, they began speaking for God instead of listening to him.  Like a house of cards they so delicately constructed, they began protecting their view of God at all cost.  In time, love turned into law, mercy gave way to self-sufficiency, and humility gave way to pride.  And pridefully, they had to be right.  They couldn’t give in.  They knew they were right.  Only, they weren’t right.  

And when truth wasn’t enough to back them, they sought to twist and turn whatever was necessary to fortify their position, defend their turf, and destroy whatever perceived enemy stood in their way.  Try as they might, they couldn’t argue with Jesus.  You just can’t argue and win when God is your opponent.  In time, many of them would discover that God cannot be placed in the little boxes we’d often like to place him.  And try as one might, one can never best love.

**Something to ponder today:**
How much do I argue with God, instead of, with a humble and teachable spirit, learn from him?

**Experience it in the Word:**
Mt 21:23-25:46 | Mk 11:27-13:37 | Lk 20:1-21:36 | Jn 12:17-50
