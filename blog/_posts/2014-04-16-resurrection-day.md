**What’s worth remembering: Resurrection + Celebration**

The empty tomb changed things forever.  As news spread about Jesus’ resurrection, more and more people believed that Jesus was who he had claimed to be: God’s very own son.  And for those who put their trust in knowing Jesus, their lives took on a whole new beauty, focus, and flavor as the love of the Risen Lord changed everything about them from the inside out.

But not everyone who heard the good news believed.  Nor did everyone receive the resurrection reports all at the same time (social media and worldwide TV newscasts were still a few thousand years away).  So, for various reasons on that very first Resurrection Day, many went about “life as usual,” unaffected by the eternal events around them.  The party may have been on, but not everyone understood or celebrated.

How about you?  Are you believing and celebrating today?  Far beyond family gatherings, dressing up in colorful new clothes, attending to religious obligations, and consuming chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, are you celebrating the Risen One, Christ in you, the hope of glory?  Are you rejoicing in and glorifying God this day that …

>Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
Because he lives, all fear is gone.
Because I know he holds the future,
And life is worth the living, just because he lives.*

**Something to ponder today:**

What does it mean to me that “Christ is risen?”  How will I celebrate that truth to fullest extent?

**Experience it in the Word:**

Matthew 28:1-15 | Mark 16:1-8 (9-20) | Luke 24:1-49 | John 20:1-18
