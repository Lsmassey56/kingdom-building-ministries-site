<p style="text-align: right;"><br />All 31 of the Experience students will graduate the program this week and be commissioned to go back into the world, mobilized as Kingdom Laborers.  They go, however, knowing the One who sees from Heaven is with them.  <br />This week, let's join them in humbly asking God to show us what He sees and how we can co-labor with Him!  <br /><br /><span class="caption"><em>The Lord looks down from heaven and sees the whole human race. From his throne he observes all who live on the earth. He made their hearts, so he understands everything they do.</em> <br />Psalm 33:13-15 NLT</span> Heavenly Father, you are seated high above the earth, exalted in your glory, righteousness, and love. You see and know the fullness of your coming Kingdom, and yet you see every present moment. My heart is open to you, Father, examine my life, and lead me in your righteousness. In your grace, would you work what is pleasing to you in me, and equip and prepare me for what you have in store? Thank you for letting me be a part of your "Plan A" for the world.  You are the hope and truth I bring, Jesus Christ. You have gone behind and before me, and I know you are with me now.  <br />All I need is you. So may your church, your Beloved Bride, <br />see what you see and hear what you hear today, all around the world. <br />Help me respond in obedience to your voice, <br />for it is my joy to follow you.</p>
