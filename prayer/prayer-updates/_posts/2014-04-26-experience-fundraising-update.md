Please know, your prayers have played a vital role in moving the kingdom forward!  We are seeing an increase of God's hand at work lately, and we have no doubt it's because there is a powerful number of you praying!  We stand amazed at all God has done and sense "more of Him, more of His will, and more of His glory" are coming.
 
Out of the total amount needed to fully fund all 28 Experience students, significant progress was made last week -- Praise God!  However, a hurdle still remains.  Of the remaining amount needed, would you specifically pray for God to provide $25,000 through faith-filled laborers?  Our prayer is that by the end of this week every student would be 100% funded!  We continue to feel the urgent need to pray, and to pray specifically.  Let us always remember that our mighty God hears us when we ask!

"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him" (Hebrews 11:6).
