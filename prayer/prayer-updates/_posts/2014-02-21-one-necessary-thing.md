"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "You are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed" (Luke 10:42).  Maybe you can identify with her lately. . .I know I can.  **But only one thing is needed today, living with God here and now.** 

"The invitation of a life of prayer is the invitation to live in the midst of this world without being caught in the net of wounds and needs.  The word "prayer" stands for a radical interruption of the vicious chain of interlocking dependencies leading to violence and war and for an entering into a totally new dwelling place.  It points to a new way of speaking, a new way of breathing, a new way of being together, a new way of knowing, yes, a whole new way of living."
~Henri J. M. Nouwen, *The Only Necessary Thing*

>Will you let prayer bring you to a new dwelling place with God today?
