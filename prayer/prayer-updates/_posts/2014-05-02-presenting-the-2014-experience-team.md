We were so thankful for the prayers you sent to the Father last summer and for those of you who "adopted a 2013 student in prayer"!  The impact your intercession had was beyond our comprehension.  We stand in awe of our faithful God.  This year, we would like to equip all of you with helpful tools to cover each student in prayer for the summer.  As a ministry, you know that we know *prayer is the most important work*!  So let's get to praying!  
 
The students arrive in just 12 days, and we can't wait to tell them how many people have been lifting them up in prayer and believing that God has the "immeasurably more than imaginable" in store.
 
The tool included this week is a team roster with names, faces, and prayer requests!  Click the link below, download the PDF file, and print it out.  As you look at their faces and offer their names before the throne this week, pray that God would fill them with His love, peace, joy and courage.  Also, pray that they would make a deep commitment to surrender to what God has in store.  If at any point in the summer you would like to send a note of encouragement or prayer to any of the students, feel free to send your message to Lzimmerman@kbm.org and it will get in their hands!

Next week, a calendar guide will be included in this e-mail to equip you to pray strategically for each stage of the summer.

Lastly, please continue to pray for complete funding for each student!  To see their fundraising status, click: <a href="http://www.kbm.org/get-involved/scholarship/candidates/" target="_blank">Scholarship a Student</a>.
