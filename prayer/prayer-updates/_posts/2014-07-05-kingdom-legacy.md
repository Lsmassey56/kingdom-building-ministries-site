During our summer discipleship programs, we ask students to prayerfully consider each domain of their life - personal, family, vocation, kingdom and world - and invite God's perspective and vision to replace their own.  The question stands, will they let God labor in and through *every* part of their lives?  God has much in store as we leave our own ego and ambitions behind to follow Him -- a Kingdom legacy that by God's faithfulness, will impact generations to come.  
 
As students seek God's heart this week, inquiring of the Kingdom legacy He desires to leave through each area of their lives, would you prayerfully consider the question also?  What new perspective and vision might He bring to you personally, within your family, for your vocation, and about your role in His kingdom and the world around you?  May we surrender to His plan and allow Him to labor in and through every area.  Little do we know how God may impact generations to come through seeking His heart like this in prayer this week!

*For the Lord is good and his love endures forever, his faithfulness continues through all generations. Psalm 100:5*
