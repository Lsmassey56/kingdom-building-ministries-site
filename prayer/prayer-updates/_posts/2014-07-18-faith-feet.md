*Show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths; guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long. ...for your love is ever before me, and I walk continually in your truth.  Psalm 25:4-5, 26:3*

God's light, truth and love lead us to walk different paths than those known by this world.  Trails of Kingdom impact, streets of selflessness, roads that overcome the shadows of our past, journeys inspired by the Holy Spirit, paths of perseverance and steps of pure faith.  We can assuredly follow in hope of the good things God has in store as the loving voice of the King calls us forward.  However treacherous the road may seem, there is rest and peace in knowing we journey hand-in-hand with Jesus Christ.  Will you follow Him to deeper intimacy, greater freedom, new perspective and faith-filled Kingdom laborering?  

*Are your faith feet ready for a new trail, one defined by God's love and truth?*
 
Seek God's face this week and offer your heart, mind, soul and strength to Him, asking if He has a new path in store:
- Personally
- For your family 
- Amongst your friends and community
- Within your workplace or school 
- At your church
- Other - _____________________ 

May God's love continually be before you.
