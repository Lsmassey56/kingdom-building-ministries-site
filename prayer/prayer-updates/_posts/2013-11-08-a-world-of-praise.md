<p style="text-align: left;">"In the life of each one of the redeemed there is a world of wonders, <br />and therefore from each there should resound a world of praises." <br />Charles H. Spurgeon</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, God has done a world of wonders in you and me!  <br />C. H. Spurgeon wrote the above quote while reflecting upon Psalm 107:8: <br />                                 <em>"Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men." </em></p>
<p>If you can, take a moment to open to Psalm 107.  There you will encounter an entire chapter of God's love, mercy and miracles in action.  It's clear to see why the people of God should be filled with nothing less than a world of praises.  For from the enslaved, the hungry wanderer, the suffering prisoner, the ill and foolish, those given to the tempest of seas, and to a life like yours and mine, we have a million praises to sing to our God for His merciful love and kindness.  We have deserved the worst, but God's great Love came.  Thank you, God!</p>
<p>To the slaves He gave freedom, brought redemption, and gathered them together in community from the ends of the earth (vs 2-3). </p>
<p>To the wandering, He provided direction and satisfied the hungry and thirsty (vs 7-9).</p>
<p>To the suffering prisoner, He tore away the darkness and broke away the chains (vs 14).</p>
<p>To the foolish and sick, He sent forth His healing Word and destroyed the grave (vs 20).</p>
<p>To those lost to the tempest of seas, He stilled the storm with a whisper and hushed the waves ( vs 29).</p>
<p>And so the writer repeats with every instance: <br /><strong>                                   Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</strong></p>
<p>To the graceless, selfish, unfaithful, striving <em>me</em>, He daily brings mercy and forgiveness while leading me to rest in His Fatherly embrace.</p>
<p>And to you?</p>
<p>Because of our loving God, a unique world of wonders fills each and every one of our lives.  May our praises reflect the boundless ways God has worked in each of our lives.  </p>
