As Deep Camp 2014 came to a close, Dwight Robertson challenged each of us to remember that this week was simply the "pep rally" for the game ahead!  With one hand extended high to our Father in heaven and the other extended out to love and reach those around us, we can live daily like eternity matters.

Whether you attended Deep Camp or not, we can all be blessed by the reminder that this life of ours is merely a breath compared to the eternity that awaits.  But on a daily basis, do we live like our flesh and earthly desires matter more?  Or do our lives reflect a daily longing for God's Kingdom come in and through us?  Do we understand that our intimate relationship with God, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and our journey of transformation is not meant to be kept to ourselves but meant for God's use to change the world and bring Him glory?
 
During the final teaching at Deep Camp, Caleb Bislow challenged us to open our ears and hearts to the voice and power of the Holy Spirit and to establish a daily pattern of listening and obeying.  Alone, our potential to change the world is small.  However, through inviting the Holy Spirit to indwell and guide our life more and more, there's no telling what the Kingdom impact will be as we obey!
 
*Each day this week, will you invite the Holy Spirit to fill you, guide you, teach you and help you?  As He speaks, listen and obey!*
