As Deep Camp 2014 came to a close, Dwight Robertson challenged each of us to remember that this week was simply the "pep rally" for the game ahead!  With one hand extended high to our Father in heaven and the other extended out to love and reach those around us, we can live daily like eternity matters.

Whether you attended Deep Camp or not, we can all be blessed by the reminder that this life of ours is merely a breath compared to the eternity that awaits.  Pausing to reflect, what tends to matter more on a daily basis: our flesh and earthly desires or a daily longing for God's Kingdom come in and through us?  Through our intimate relationship with God, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, God's Word and following the Master disciple-maker, we can grow each day in seeing life from an eternal perspective.
 
During the final teaching at Deep Camp, Caleb Bislow challenged us to open our ears and hearts to the voice and power of the Holy Spirit and to establish a daily pattern of listening to Him and obeying.  Alone, our potential to change the world is small.  However, through inviting the Holy Spirit to indwell us and to guide our life more and more, there's no telling what the Kingdom impact will be as we obey!
 
*Each day this week, will you invite the Holy Spirit to fill you, guide you, teach you and help you?  As He speaks, listen and obey!*
