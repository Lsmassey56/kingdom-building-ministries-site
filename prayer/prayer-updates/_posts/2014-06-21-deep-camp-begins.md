Families, young adults, high school and middle school students, church and youth groups, and Kingdom Building Ministries' staff and speakers venture today to Winter Park for a week away focused on growing closer to God!  We look forward to this week all year, not just for the amazing view of the Rocky Mountains, but because there is great opportunity for God's heart and truth come alive in hearts and lives and fuel a new movement of Kingdom laborers.  Please pray for God's will to be done and Kingdom to come in each session and each break out time!  For a schedule of our itinerant speaking team's involvement, view the list below.  Thank you for your prayers!
