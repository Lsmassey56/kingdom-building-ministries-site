Hearts were filled with overflowing joy in commissioning this team of kingdom laborers yesterday!  This summer we have witnessed the miracles God brings about when a life says "yes" to Jesus and responds to the voice of the King, and we want to thank you for saying "yes" to pray for their lives and this generation. 
 
Throughout scripture Jesus used tiny examples to illustrate how He can transform the ordinary into having extraordinary Kingdom impact -- a mustard seed, a widow's mite, one coin, twelve ordinary men -- and we believe He will do no different with each life on this team.  Could it be that the tide could turn within a generation who yearns for more than a half-hearted and lukewarm lifestyle of devotion to the King?  We believe it's possible, and we believe as these lives continue to say "yes" to the King that He will use them to change their generation and generations beyond as a display of His glory.   
 
*Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  Matthew 6:9-10*

...may it be so in Jesus' Name.
