Have you ever wondered where our desire to pray comes from?  In our flesh, I'm not sure if it's something we can take any credit for.  Could it be that God is actually the one doing the drawing?  Could it be that He loves us so much that He desires to be with us and have our attention to teach us, guide us, love and comfort us, heal us, etc.?

Consider the following by Henri J. M. Nouwen as you reflect:

"I am deeply convinced that the necessity to pray, and to pray unceasingly, is not so much based on our desire for God as on God's desire for us.  It is God's passionate pursuit of us that calls us to prayer.  Prayer comes from God's initiative, not ours.  It might sound shocking, but it is biblical to say: God wants us more than we want God!  The English spiritual writer Anthony Bloom says it better than I when he writes:
>We complain that God does not make himself present to us for the few minutes we reserve for him, but what about the twenty-three and a half hours during which God may be knocking at our door and we answer, "I am busy.  I am sorry."  Or when we do not answer at all because we do not even hear the knock at the door of our heart, of our mind, of our conscience, of our life.  So there is a situation in which we have no right to complain of the absence of God, because we are a great deal more absent than he ever is.

As long as we continue to reduce prayer to occasional piety we keep running away from the mystery of God's jealous love, the love in which we are created, redeemed, and made holy."  Henri J. M. Nouwen, *Prayer and the Jealous God*

In light of this, how will you respond the next time you sense a drawing from God to pray?  May His desire for you fan the flame of your desire for Him.

*Praise the Lord, O my soul, all my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits -- who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.*  Psalm 103:1-5
