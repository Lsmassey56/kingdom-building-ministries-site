<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And we all, who with unveiled faces reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with <br /></em><em>ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit</em> (2 Corinthians 3:18).</p>
<p>Consumed as a sacrifice before God, we can be filled more deeply with Christ! This means that God's glory can powerfully be made known through our lives.  Paul described that our hope of glory is "Christ in us" (Col. 1:27) . . . and nothing else.</p>
<p><span class="caption">More of God. <br />More of His will. <br />More of His GLORY!</span> When others come up close to your life, what do they notice?  Is it Christ in you?  May it be our prayer that others are pointed to Jesus through us.  We all know the story of Moses after he received the 10 Commandments from God. He had spent so much time on the mountain that his intimacy with God vividly radiated to everyone around him.  God expresses through His Word that His heart is for us to be transformed into His likeness and image with <strong>ever-increasing glory that comes from the Lord.</strong> God answers our prayer for more of His glory when we let Him miraculously turn us into vessels He can use to point the world to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Does your life vividly reflect Jesus to others? </strong><br /><strong>Go forth this week radiating the likeness of Jesus as you're filled and transformed for His glory.</strong></p>
