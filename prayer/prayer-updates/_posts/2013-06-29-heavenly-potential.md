<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Every moment in life is pregnant with eternal implications.  </strong><br /><strong>Will you play your part?"</strong><br />John Vermilya, KBM Itinerant</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="caption"><em>Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying,</em><br /><em>"This is the way; walk in it."</em><br />Isaiah 30:21</span>The heart of a Kingdom Laborer understands that at any given moment, God may have appointed an important assignment to enter into.  With eternal implications in mind, the daily faces and places we live life near suddenly become much more significant. What role is God asking you to play in the seemingly ordinary circumstances of your life?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">God is, without a doubt, drawing someone around you to His Son.  Will you be a piece of the Kingdom come in their life?</p>
<p>Entering into prayer and intimacy with the Father allows Him to align our hearts with this transformed way of thinking.  This week, continue to pray daily for more laborers, and also ask for eyes to see the moments around you that are "pregnant" with heavenly potential.</p>
