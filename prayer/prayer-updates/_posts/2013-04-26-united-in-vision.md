<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Corbel; mso-bidi-font-family: Corbel;">We've been reminded this month that our position of prayer and intimacy with Jesus is essential for living a lifestyle of laboring for God's Kingdom.  We may weary, but Jesus revives us as we come to depend on Him.  He revives our hearts, not for our gain, but for His glory, as our hearts and minds are set in unity with His purposes for the world.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Corbel; mso-bidi-font-family: Corbel;">This week, let your heart catch fresh vision and fire in why you pray, and let a new filling of God's Spirit EXCITE YOU!  You are called and appointed to PRAY!  You are UNITED with God's heart and UNITED with believers ALL AROUND THE WORLD as you come before the throne in prayer. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Corbel; mso-bidi-font-family: Corbel;"><br />Reflect on these words from Wesley Duewel, in his book, <em>Touch the World through Prayer </em>(pg. 13-14):<br /></span><span style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;">"Prayer is the greatest resource of the church.  It is the most effective means of preparing the way of the Lord available to us as Christians today.  </span><strong style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;">You yourself can influence more people for God and have a greater role in advancing Christ's cause by prayer than any other way.  </strong><span style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;">It is not the </span><em style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;">only</em><span style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;"> thing you must do, but it is the </span><em style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;">greatest</em><span style="font-family: Corbel; font-size: 13pt;"> thing you can do.  It has often been said, </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Corbel; mso-bidi-font-family: Corbel;">If that is true, <strong>think what could happen if</strong> every Christian really took his prayer role seriously and began to pray regularly and specifically, uniting with thousands or millions of others, all praying for the same priority needs around the world.  <br />Are you willing to be a part of such a <strong>prayer army?</strong>"</span></p>
