"But what about you?" Jesus asked.  "Who do you say I am?"  
Peter answered, "The Christ (or Messiah) of God."  
And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.  For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it." (Luke 9:20-24)

>The season of Lent continues, and with it this question: "Who do you say Jesus is?"

The disciples initially responded to Jesus' question using answers others had given, answers that did not suffice nor are adequate for us...No, Jesus replied, who do *you* say that I am?  And the revelation of the answer brought with it a call to follow Jesus daily and daily deny self - the same call to live and die we are daily presented with.

The more we choose self over bowing our life to Jesus' Lordship, the more we reduce Him to a mere man, teacher, or prophet others say He is.  If Jesus is Lord and Savior, then every area of our lives should (to our greatest joy)  be submitted to Him and display His mark of ownership.

Does the revelation of who Jesus is need renewing in your life?  Take some time today in prayer and evaluate your heart and life.  What are you unwilling to lose for the sake of Jesus Christ?  May you discover newfound life in Jesus Christ as the powerful revelation of who He is renewed.

"Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.  And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death - even death on a cross!" (Philippians 2:5-8)
