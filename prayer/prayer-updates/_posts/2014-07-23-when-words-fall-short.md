title: When Words Fall Short

You've heard the phrase before, and most likely uttered it yourself: "Words just can't describe how ________ I feel." It's true, words can often fall short of the deep emotion we experience.  The good news is, we don't have to be stuck without words in prayer -- God so graciously created us to express our heart in many different ways.

We are mistaken to believe our only option to commune with our Father is to speak, and we are also mistaken to believe His only avenue to reach us is through words.  With God minimized in the small boxes we tend to put Him in, our prayer life can become stifled.

Just as being together with a friend, the beauty of nature, a captivating image, or a heavenly melody will reach a heart more than words at times, what if our communion with Jesus is similar?  How would you pray or express your heart right now if you could see that Jesus was physically present with you?

*Would you...
- Open your hand to hold His
- Feel or envision His embrace
- Kneel in reverence of His holiness and the splendor of His majesty
- Lift your hands in thanksgiving and worship
- Draw, create or make something with Him or as an offering unto Him
- Walk or run with Him by your side
- Hum or use an instrument to sing the melody in your soul
- Cup your hands to receive from Him
- Curl up under His wings of shelter*

Take note of how God responds as you draw near to Him in new ways and know He truly is with you.  And as you have box-breaking communion with Jesus this week, may your prayers find new life!

*Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand...Whom have I in heaven but you?  And earth has nothing I desire besides you.  My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and portion forever...as for me, it is good to be near God.  I have made the sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.
Psalm 73:23,25-26, 28*

*The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.  We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
John 1:14*
