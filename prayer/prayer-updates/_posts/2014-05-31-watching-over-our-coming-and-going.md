The first stage of *The Experience* is complete and the students have been commissioned to begin the international stage!  On Monday, each team will fly to their respective country - Haiti, the Dominican Republic, or Honduras.  The students are excited to serve, learn, grow, and co-labor with the work God is up to around them.
 
With *The Experience* teams sent, we are excited to welcome the *16 Days* team on Thursday, June 5th!  Would you cover these students in prayer in the same way you've been interceding for the 2014  Experience team?  To help fuel your prayers, download and print their team roster.

As we pray Psalm 121 over the coming and going of these teams, perhaps you will also find this passage meaningful in your prayers this week.
 
"I lift up my eyes to the mountains - where does my help come from?  
My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. 
He will not let your foot slip - he who watches over you will not slumber; 
indeed, he who watches over Israel; will neither slumber nor sleep.  
The Lord watches over you - the Lord is your shade at your right hand; 
the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.  
The Lord will keep you from all harm - he will watch over your life; 
the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore."
Psalm 121
