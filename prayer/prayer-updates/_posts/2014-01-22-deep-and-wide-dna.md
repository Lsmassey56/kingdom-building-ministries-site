2014 is on its way!  How's the journey been so far?  As Kingdom Building Ministries prepares for another summer of discipleship training, I'm reminded of a grid of values we hope to pass on to students as they seek to live a life of laborship.  I wonder if they might be helpful as you desire to dedicate 2014 to God, be transformed in His image, and grow in laboring for the King.  We've found 7 "Deep" (loving God) and 7 "Wide" (loving others) Kingdom values in Scripture that could be said characterize the life "DNA" of a Kingdom Laborer. It's certainly not a list to conquer or accomplish, but is a helpful spiritual roadmap for 2014 and beyond.

Prayerfully look over the list below.  Are there any areas the Lord is highlighting for you to dig deeper and wider into this year?  As your intimacy and love for God continues to grow deeper, may your love and laborship spread wider for the glory of our King.  Also, include these values when you ask and pray for God to raise up more laborers!
