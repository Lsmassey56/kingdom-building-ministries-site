How often do we take God seriously in His desire for us to live life abundantly? Considering the question myself, I am made aware of how easily I sink into the day-to-day routine patterns in which my heart and soul become disengaged and less than fully alive.  I don't know about you, but when I finally wake up to notice the dullness, I desperately desire to come to the Gardener, my Savior Jesus.  

Lent is a season prior to Jesus' crucifixion for believers to reflect, examine, and re-align heart and soul with Life, Light, and Truth.  A local Denver pastor speaks of Lent as: "... a time where we bear down on all the areas of our life that are less than the "abundant life" (John 10) offered to us by Jesus and seek to move intentionally towards the fulfillment of our humanity in the presence of God.  For each of us, there are places where the "life that is truly life" is thwarted in us due to distraction, busyness, sin, misplaced feelings of obligation, routine, and boredom.  During Lent, we ask ourselves once again, 'What am I made for, and what does life in Christ make possible for me?' and begin to creatively and courageously move towards it."       

Maybe you've engaged the season of Lent this year.  How have you chosen to engage it?  What has God been up to in your pursuit of Him?  However involved you are in the season, take time to examine yourself and ask Jesus, "Am I fully alive?  What areas in my life exist where I am living less than the abundant life you desire for me?" As Jesus answers, may you abandon yourself to His tender work and even courageously pursue it!  May His watering saturate us, may He clip away that which is dead and hindering, and may His light shine down on us truth, comfort, and guidance.  As our roots deepen, may we know He delights in extending loving watchfulness and grace while we grow and transform.

>*Spirit of the Living God, be the Gardener of my soul.
For so long I have been waiting, silent and still - 
Experiencing a winter of the soul.
But now, in the strong name of Jesus Christ, I dare to ask:
Clear away the dead growth of the past,
Break up the hard clods of custom and routine,
Stir in the rich component of vision and challenge,
Bury deep in my soul the implanted Word,
Cultivate and water and tend my heart,
Until new life buds and opens and flowers.
Amen.*
