*It's more than "a camp"; we've seen (time and again) MIRACLES of profoundly changed lives who are walking with God in their calling from Him, renewed and different as a result of five days in the mountains with Him!* 
~Dwight Robertson
 
This week is a crucial week for those considering life-changing participation at Deep Camp 2014!  Dwight Robertson has sent out special video invitations that arrived in email inboxes yesterday.  Would you pray for over those invitations?  We pray they are seen and that the Holy Spirit would stir in people a hunger to become a heart on fire and life on purpose, equipped for a lifetime of laboring for the Kingdom.  We are believing for all available rooms to be filled!
The deadline to apply is one week from this Monday, on April 21 we will be making rooming assignments!  Is there someone on your heart to invite?  Feel free to share the link to Dwight's video: <a href="http://www.kbm.org/events/deep-camp-invitation/" target="_blank">www.kbm.org/deepcampinvitation</a>.
This is an urgent week to pray.  Thank you for laboring with us.
