                <h1>Revive us, Father</h1><br>

                <p>This month's theme centers around the word, revive. In the reality of our human weakness, we often find ourselves needing a fresh reminder and understanding of why we pray, which essentially comes through spending intimate time with our Heavenly Father.</p>

                <div class="kbm-full-col" style="background:#cd1f29;font-size:large;text-align:center;">
                    <dl>
                        <dt><strong>REVIVE</strong> (<em>verb</em>) \ri-ˈvīv\</dt>

                        <dt>re·vived, re·viv·ing, re·vives<br><br></dt>

                        <dd>- To bring back to life or consciousness, resuscitate .</dd>

                <p>If you allow yourself a moment of honesty, do you find your heart asking to be revived? Are you weary and burdened? Do you feel numb and unresponsive to the place of prayer or to your role as a laborer in the Kingdom? Kneel at Jesus' feet and let Him teach you how to intercede according to His will. Let God revive you with His truth and renew within you a steadfast spirit to depend on Him each day. The coming week is full of doing, going, serving, caring, and loving. Thankfully, our gracious God has already provided all that we need - His Word (alive and active), the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and the greatest prayer partner we could ever have, Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>A challenge to you: Set aside time this week to spend intimately with your Heavenly Father, in prayer. Our loving Savior smiles when we humbly bring our distracted, weary, deadened, and numb hearts to Him as an offering. He knows just how to revive us, not for our gain, but for the glory of His Name.</p>

                <p>REVIVE our hearts we pray, Heavenly Father, to passionately labor in prayer. Your Kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
