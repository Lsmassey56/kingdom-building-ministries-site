<p>For meditation (from the Book of Common Prayer):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Eternal God, in whose perfect kingdom no sword is drawn</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">but the sword of righteousness, no strength known but the strength of love:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So mightily spread abroad your Spirit, that all peoples may be gathered </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">under the banner of the Prince of Peace, as children of one Father; </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to whom be dominion and glory, now and for ever. Amen. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In the midst of the great suffering and injustice we see in the world daily, </strong><br /><strong>may we seek and intercede for the kind of justice Jesus characterizes, love and humility.  </strong></p>
<p><em>No, O people, the LORD has told you what is good, and this is what he requires of you: <br />to do what is right, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.</em>  <br />Micah 6:8</p>
