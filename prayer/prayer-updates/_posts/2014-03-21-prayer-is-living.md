>O God, teach us to recognize you are always with us.  Help us eliminate the compartments we've created to separate daily life and spirituality so we can more fully experience the abundant life found in communing with you! 

"Prayer leads you to see new paths and to hear new melodies in the air.  Prayer is the breath of your life which gives you freedom to go and to stay where you wish and to find the many signs which point out the way to a new land.  Praying is not simply some necessary compartment in the daily schedule of a Christian or a source of support in time of need, nor is it restricted to Sunday mornings or mealtimes.  Praying is living.  It is eating and drinking, action and rest, teaching and learning, playing and working.  Praying pervades every aspect of our lives.  It is the unceasing recognition that God is wherever we are, always inviting us to come closer and to celebrate the divine gift of being alive."
Henri J. M. Nouwen, *With Open Hands*

"As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.
By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me - a prayer to the God of my life" (Psalm 42:1, 8).
