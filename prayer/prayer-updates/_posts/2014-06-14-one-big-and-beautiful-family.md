*For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will -- to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. Ephesians 1:4-6*

Spiritual brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers -- our kingdom family is big and beautiful!  Since discovering home is heaven, many on our Experience teams realize during the international stage that they have family all over the world, sewn together in heart and mind through belief and sonship in Jesus Christ.  Moreover, they witness the truth that no language barrier or cultural divide can stand in the way of God's love or the power of prayer!  
 
Thank YOU for praying for these teams, God has worked in miraculous ways in and through each team member.  We look forward to their return this Thursday. 
 
For the final week of 16 Days, please continue to pray each student would invite God's work (freedom, healing, true identity, purpose) in every area of their lives.
