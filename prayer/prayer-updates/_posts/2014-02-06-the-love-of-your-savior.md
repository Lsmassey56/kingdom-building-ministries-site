>Does the way you pray reflect belief that you are LOVED by your Friend, Savior, King, and Heavenly Father?

You are intimately loved by a Friend, His name is Jesus.
You are also passionately loved by a Savior.
 
As Jesus walked step by step, bloody, beaten, bruised, the weight of the wooden cross too much to bear, He had you in mind.  The day He made perfect atonement for the sins of the world He knew your story would be forever changed.  Because of Christ's passionate obedience to the Father, your brokenness can now become a testimony of redemption and beauty, your sin is now forgiven, and from captivity you are delivered.  All because the Savior loved you. 

When you come to Jesus in prayer, can you see Him on the cross?  Can you kneel at the foot of it and let His blood wash you clean?  Can you see Him standing risen and victorious, smiling in all His glory, with marked hands stretched out to you?  How will you respond?  What will you say to Him?  Will you worship and adore?  Will you cry out for mercy, healing, or deliverance?  Will the sight of this Love lead you to your knees in repentance or will you run at Him full speed to bury your face in His arms as you weep with thanksgiving?

Pray, as one forgiven and washed by Jesus' blood, redeemed, and humbled by His passionate love for you.

*But now, this is what the Lord says - he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine...For I am the Lord, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior."*
Isaiah 43:1,3

*I am now utterly convinced that on judgment day, the Lord Jesus will ask each of us one question: "Did you believe that I loved you?"*
