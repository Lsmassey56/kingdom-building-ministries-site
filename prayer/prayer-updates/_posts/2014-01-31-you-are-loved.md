Before you start your prayers this week, pause for a minute and ask yourself this question: Does the way I pray reflect my belief that God passionately and intimately loves me? 

It's the month of February already and whether we like it or not, the heart-shaped balloons, red glittery cards, and flowers are making their appearance.  So, I figured we might as well dig a little deeper into our love-relationship with our Creator and discuss how that relates to the way we pray!  And in all seriousness, I'm praying God's love would truly revolutionize our prayer lives this month.
 
> Does the way you pray reflect belief that you are LOVED 
by your Friend, Savior, King, and Heavenly Father?

We'll start with Jesus as a Friend this week.  Do you believe you have a best friend in Jesus?  Do you walk with Him, talk with Him, and sit with Him in that comfortable silence you only experience with those closest to you?  Do you honor the time you'll spend together?  Do you share honestly?  Do you approach Him as someone completely unfamiliar, unknown, or distant?

"But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother."
Proverbs 18:24

There is no other god in the universe who makes himself known, invites us into friendship, and passionately loves us!  We know this is true because of what He did on the cross, but do we actually pray like it's true?  We don't pray to a distant unknown God, Jesus is up-close and personal!  He is the best friend we will EVER have.  And the friendship goes both ways - because of God's Word and the way He speaks to us in unique ways, His heart and character is no secret.  In the way that you invest with a sister, brother, or friend, get to know HIM!  His love for you is deep and intentional.  Find out what pleases Him just as He knows exactly how to lovingly get your attention.  May our prayer life reflect more and more that we have a most loving friendship with our God.

"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.  Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.  You are my friends if you do what I command.  I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business.  Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you."
John 15:12-15   
 
You are passionately and intimately loved by a Friend, His name is Jesus.
