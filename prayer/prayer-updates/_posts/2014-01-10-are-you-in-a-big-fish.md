"But the Lord provided a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights." 
Jonah 1:17

Have you ever noticed how the word "provided" shows up in Jonah's story?  We don't tend to thank God for the big fish who swallow us as we're disobediently running from difficulty.  But shouldn't we know by now that God's discipline is actually a display of His mercy and love, an opportunity for transformation...His provision?

Jesus Christ suffered the cross in obedience to His Father and died for humanity's sin.  After three days the victory was won - death was conquered for you and I.  In Him we find the hope we need to live faithfully through our circumstances.  In Him, we realize that His loving desire for you and I is to make us more holy, to make us more like Him.  His provision is perfect.   

"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.  And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.  And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us."
Romans 5:1-5

Have you found yourself in the belly of a big fish after running from difficulty or obedience?  Turn to God in prayer as Jonah does in Chapter 2 and thank Him for His goodness.  You are in the just the right place to reflect on the sacrifice Christ made that brought perfect provision.  He will supply the endurance you need as the fish spits you out to re-enter the scene.  May the suffering you experience produce perseverance, character, and hope as God covers you in His love.
