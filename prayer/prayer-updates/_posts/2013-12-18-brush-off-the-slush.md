Can joy be found at Christmas without a fireplace and stockings, without cookies and hot chocolate, and without a warm embrace?  With all of our hearts we must say yes. 

"Joy to the world!  The Lord has come!  Let earth receive her King!  Let every heart prepare Him room, and heaven and nature sing."  This familiar hymn, Joy to the World, can preach!  Have you sung it lately?  Our Savior reigns, and every living thing will repeat the sounding joy!  He came to let sin and sorrow grow no more, and to cast the curse we know far away.  Through the wonders of Christ's love He will rule the world with truth and grace, and all nations will know the glories of His righteousness. 

The type of joy found in Christ will always transcend what we know and experience in this world.  Some think the opposite of joy is sorrow and grief, however, scripture is pretty clear we will experience pain and suffering in this life. Yet, scripture also testifies that with the Holy Spirit of God living in us, we know a love, JOY and peace that is present through everything.  

What is the opposite of joy, then, if it's not sorrow and grief?  Since heavenly joy is a result of the gift of Christ alive in us, then the opposite of joy gets stuck in our lives through too much of "me"... the "me" that is sinful, selfish, prideful, and doesn't believe God's character is trustworthy and true.  It's like the nice car with the dirty slush stuck to the bottom rims and hanging like an iceberg behind the tires.  You feel joyful, "mostly."  You're good, "for the most part."  

Don't miss the FULLNESS of joy this Advent season.  The fireplace, stockings and cookies won't suffice.  Brush off the slush, let your flesh die, be humbled, confess freely before your savior and let your heart come alive in joyful worship to Jesus!  As your heart prepares Him room and receives Him King, may heavenly joy flood your soul.

"And the ransomed of the Lord will return.  They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads.
Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away."
Isaiah 35:10
