Friday, May 16th, twenty eight young adults walked through the doors of Kingdom Building Ministries!  We cannot articulate how thankful we are for you and the way your prayers help move God's work forward.  God has and will continue working miracles through the power of prayer, and our staff moves forward with joy this summer knowing you are co-laboring with us!  May the work God does in each student equip them to impact generations of Kingdom laborers to come.
