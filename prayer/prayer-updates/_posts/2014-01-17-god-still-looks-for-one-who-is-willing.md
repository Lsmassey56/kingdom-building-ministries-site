This week, be encouraged by a powerful reminder that your prayers matter from an article entitled, "Standing in the Gap," by Dwight Robertson.
 
God is looking for people to be channels through which His power can flow into the lives of others.  God's desire is to work in people's lives - whether it's freeing them from the snares of sin, healing them of their physical illnesses or ministering to their emotional wounds.  But He often chooses to do His work through His people - through their words, actions and prayers.  It's as if He looks for connectors through which He can channel His love and power.
 
Remember His words through the prophet Ezekiel?  The Lord said:
"I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none" (Ezekiel 22:30).
 
These words were spoken during a time when the Israelites were in rebellion against God.  God was looking for someone among them who would intercede for them, turning away His wrath.  But He found none.  The amazing thing is that it would have only taken one person.  He would have honored the intercession of even one person!  He would have responded and acted differently based on one person who was willing to stand in the gap.
 
He's still looking for _**one**_ intercessor, _**one**_ prayer warrior, _**one**_ person who will stand in the gap and act as a connector between Him (the Power Source) and others in the places of life where we find ourselves.  It's a divine partnership between God and us.  Will He find that we're willing?

Samuel Chadwick once said, "Satan dreads nothing but prayer.  His one concern is to keep the saints from praying.  He fears nothing from our prayerless studies, prayerless work, prayerless religion.  He laughs at our toil, mocks our wisdom, but trembles when we pray."
 
**Clearly, prayer doesn't need more proof. It needs more practice.**
