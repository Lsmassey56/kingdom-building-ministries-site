Does the way you pray reflect belief that you are LOVED by your 
Friend, Savior, King, and **Heavenly Father**?

You are intimately loved by a Friend, His name is Jesus.
You are passionately loved by a Savior.
The King's loving pursuit for *all you are* will never end.  
>You are tenderly cared for through the eyes of your loving heavenly Father.

We have a Father up in heaven!  A Father who sees, loves, provides, teaches, disciplines, and burns with desire to see our lives transformed to the best He's made possible.  He is ALL good.

We learn a lot about our Father in heaven through the way Jesus taught in scripture.  Regarding prayer,  Matthew 6:9 says this: 
*This, then, is how you should pray:
"Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name. . . "*

Using Jesus' prayer in Matthew 6 as a guide, I was once challenged by a mentor to not continue past verse 9, "Our Father in heaven," without fully believing that God truly was my heavenly Father.  It transformed my time in prayer.  You see, many of the worries and fears we have vanish when we believe in the Father's love (His care, provision, and loving discipline).  The process may take battling and wrestling . . . it's worth it.  Some days this exercise proves more difficult than other days, but the process of surrendering and trusting in God's good and Fatherly character will build a strong foundation for the journey onward.

>Why not give this exercise a try this week?  

Before you begin, invite God to search your heart and examine it.  Start the Lord's Prayer and pause right after you begin.  "Our Father in heaven . . ."
What in your mind and heart exists that does not believe God is not the perfect and loving Father He is?  What are you worried and fearful over?  What are you unwilling to submit to His discipline?  Move on when you've surrendered and feel peace fill your heart.  You are tenderly cared for through the eyes of your loving heavenly Father.

*From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind; from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth -- he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.*
Psalm 33:13-15

*Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.  **Are you not much more valuable than they?**  Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?  And why do you worry about clothes?  See how the lilies of the field grow.  They do not labor or spin.  Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.  If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"  For the pagans run after all these things, and **your heavenly Father knows that you need them.**  But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.*
Matthew 6:26-33

*Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons.  For what son is not disciplined by his father? . . . **How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live!**  Our fathers disciplined us for a while as they thought best; but **God disciplines us for our good**, that we may share in his holiness.  No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.  **Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace** for those who have been trained by it.*
Hebrews 12:7-11
