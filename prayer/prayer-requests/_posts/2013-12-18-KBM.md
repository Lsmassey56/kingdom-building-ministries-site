***The Experience:***
3 teams go to 3 countries!  This Monday, students will be flying to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras.  We know God has gone behind and before them.  Pray they will pursue new levels of love for God and others, and be filled with joy in co-laboring with God in the ways He is building His Kingdom.

***16 Days:***
Thursday June 5, the students arrive!  Pray for safe travel, peace for their families, final financial provision, and for hearts to be open and ready for a transformative time with Jesus.

***Deep Camp:***
Please continue to pray for the planning of each day's activities which will incorporate children, teens, young adults, and adults!  Knowing this week is being saturated in prayer fills us with great anticipation for all God will do - thank you for praying!
