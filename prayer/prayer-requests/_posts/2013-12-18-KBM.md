*The Experience:*
The application deadline is approaching, please pray for those who are still considering this opportunity but haven't fully committed yet.  Also, please pray for the fundraising efforts of students who are participating.

*16 Days:*
Our speakers have had many larger events with high school students lately.  Pray that those encounters with God are real and lasting - not just a weekend "mountaintop" experience.  Pray for hearts to be ready to respond if God leads any to continue their discipleship journey with us this summer.

*Deep Camp:*
Pray specifically for families who are ready for God to revolutionize the way they seek Him together.  Pray that God would call those who are hungry for more of Him to invest a week of their summer deeply seeking Him.
