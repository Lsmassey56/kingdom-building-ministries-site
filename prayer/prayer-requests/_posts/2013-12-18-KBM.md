***The Experience:***
Your urgent prayers are also needed for this year's Experience team!  Thousands of fundraising dollars that have yet to come in, but we know that nothing is too big for our God!  He owns the cattle on a thousand hills!  Pray for faith, perseverance, and trust for these students as they believe and work diligently.  May this journey be one they will always remember as a time God provided in miraculous ways.  If you feel led to send a gift for them, you can learn more at <a href="http://www.kbm.org/get-involved/scholarship/" target="_blank">www.kbm.org/get-involved/scholarship</a> .

***16 Days:***
We are so excited for the ways this group of high school students keeps growing!  God has BIG things in store for them.  Please pray for the logistics of the program to continue being planned appropriately and for God to lead and guide every decision!  Also, please pray for their fundraising efforts!

***Deep Camp:***
We hope to see many NEW faces at Deep Camp this summer!  Please pray with us as we commit all details and logistical aspects of Deep Camp to God.  Rooms are being reserved, space is being booked and services are being planned!  Please pray that individuals and families respond to God's leading to come and that God would make a way financially.  Several churches are considering promoting Deep Camp to their congregations!  Praise God!
