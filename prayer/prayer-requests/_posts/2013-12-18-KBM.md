***The Experience:***
The application deadline for The Experience is this week, February 28!  We trust God will bring exactly who He desires to be a part of this summer's team.  For students still considering, may any hindrances of hearing God's voice be defeated.  This week, also be praying for our Summer Staff who are preparing and fundraising.

***16 Days:***
Youth retreat season is still in full swing!  Continue to pray that lives would have genuine encounters with Jesus Christ and that their passion to follow Him would grow.  We praise God for the students who are already signed up to participate in 16 Days this summer!  Be praying for their fundraising efforts and for their hearts to be prepared.

***Deep Camp:***
Be praying for families you know who are struggling.  May they turn in the right direction - to Jesus Christ!  Don't be shy to recommend Deep Camp to families you know - it may be just what they need to help bring God back to their center.
