***The Experience:***
Thank you for your prayers during the team's final week - they were strongly felt.  As they transition back home, please continue to pray for each student.  Pray they would depend on God, be filled with peace and joy, and believe that He will carry through the specific plans and purposes He has for their lives.  Pray also for their confidence in sharing the transformation God has done - may the ripple effect of His goodness begin to spill over into the lives of their family, friends and community for God's glory.
