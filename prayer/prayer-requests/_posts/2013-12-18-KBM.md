***The Experience:***
Students this week will be challenged physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  Pray they would invite Jesus Christ into every area of their lives in deeper ways.  May they know that when they are weak, He is strong.  Also, pray they would be filled with passion and excitement to learn how to share their faith!

***16 Days:***
16 Days begins in less than a month!  Please continue to send your prayers for God's provision with these high school students.  Their tuition cost is $2,000, and many are well on their way.  May each student and their families know God has gone both behind and before them.

***Deep Camp:***
There are no new updates besides the continued request to pray that God would prepare hearts, minds, individuals, and families for this impactful week!  Also, please continue to pray for the planning of each day and for all the logistical elements to fall rightfully into place.
