***The Experience:***
This week continue to pray for our 2014 Experience Team and Summer Staff who are preparing and fundraising!  May God begin preparing their hearts to receive all He has in store!  Also, please pray over all logistical elements of the summer -- from planning and transportation, lodging and details, and our international components.

***16 Days:***
As applications continue to come in, pray for our interview sessions with students.  As we Skype with them, may they feel encouraged, loved, and challenged to pursue Jesus Christ.

***Deep Camp:***
Who do you know that you could invite to Deep Camp?  We love to see new faces each summer.  May God ignite a new movement of Kingdom laborers!
