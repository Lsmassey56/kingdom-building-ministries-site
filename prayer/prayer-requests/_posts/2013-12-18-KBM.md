***The Experience:***
The month of May has arrived!  For students, summer staff, and our staff team, these next two weeks will be very full!  Would you pray that we would all turn to God's word, praise and worship, and prayer?  May we remember the weapons God has provided to wield against any discouraging scheme the enemy would attempt.

***16 Days:***
We reached the application deadline last week (March 31), but would you pray for any remaining students who have felt led to come but have not yet applied?  May God supply them with the courage, boldness, and clarity they may need.  Also, please continue to pray for our planning and preparation.

***Deep Camp:***
There are no new updates besides the continued request to pray that God would prepare hearts, minds, individuals, and families for this impactful week!  Also, please continue to pray for the planning of each day and for all the logistical elements to fall rightfully into place.
