***The Experience:***
On April 3rd, we are having the group's first "Team Call."  Prior to the summer, we engage the whole team over a few conference calls!  We are so excited to bring this summer's team together for the first time.  Please pray over the logistics of the phone call, and for students to be filled with love, joy, grace and peace in Jesus Christ.  Also, please pray God would supply perseverance and faith as they continue to raise funds.

***16 Days:***
The team is growing and our excitement grows with it!  May each of these high school students and their families be covered in prayer as they prepare for this journey.  This week, may the love of their Heavenly Father be undeniably close and tangible.

***Deep Camp:***
Please pray with us as we commit all details and logistical aspects of Deep Camp to God.  Rooms are being reserved, and space is being booked!  Please pray that individuals and families respond to God's leading to come...several churches are considering promoting Deep Camp to their congregations!  Praise God!
