***The Experience:***
Each team is engaging well overseas!  Pray God's loving leadership would be clear as they seek to move deeper into the relationships that have been built.  Pray also for each team's health and for wisdom and guidance for team leaders.

***16 Days:***
What a joy it's been to finally have each member of the 16 Days team here!  Their hearts are hungry for Jesus Christ.  Pray this week that God would meet them in powerful ways as they invite Jesus into every area of their life and grow closer as a team.

***Deep Camp:***
Deep Camp is just two weeks away!  Please pray that hearts would be prepared and open for all God has in store.  We are praising God in advance for all He will do - thank you for praying!
