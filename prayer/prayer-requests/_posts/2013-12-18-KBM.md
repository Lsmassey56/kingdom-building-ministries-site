May the powerful truths found within this Advent season awaken more Laborers into the Kingdom! Thank you for praying with us - may we all be a light wherever we go. Also, please continue to lift up the 2013 Giving Match Opportunity in prayer - we are so thankful for the provision God has been bringing and anticipate seeing its fullest. Lastly, KBM base camp is wrapping up a final week of work before breaking for Christmas - May God help us as a staff to complete the tasks at hand (the renovation, student recruitment, various projects, and preparation for 2014).
