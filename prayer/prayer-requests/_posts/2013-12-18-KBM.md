***The Experience:***
Thank you for your prayers during Wander Week - the team had an incredible time discovering God's heart and being Christ's hands and feet to the cities they were sent to.  This week marks the final week of The Experience 2014!  As graduation approaches on Saturday, pray for students to be filled with peace, depend on God, and look for confidence and direction from Him.  Also, please pray for God's guidance and encouragement as each student participates in a Life Planning process throughout the week.
