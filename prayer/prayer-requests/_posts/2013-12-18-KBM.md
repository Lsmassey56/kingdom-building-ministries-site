***The Experience:***
This is the final week of the international stage - teams travel back to Denver, Colorado this Thursday.  Pray for discipleship relationships to deepen, endurance, joy, and for God to speak to hearts through the debriefing process.

***16 Days:***
This is another full week for the 16 Days team!  Pray their hearts would continue to be open to God's transforming truth as they hear teachings on legacy, identity, and the value of one.  Also, we pray God leads and guides their life planning time on Friday.  Finally, with graduation on Saturday, may they know and feel God's smile upon them as they are commissioned as kingdom laborers.

***Deep Camp:***
Deep Camp begins one week from today!  Pray for safe travel and prepared hearts!  Also, please lift up each session of teaching, worship and discussion, asking God to move powerfully.  May individuals and families leave transformed, with a deeper and more intimate relationship with God, commissioned into the unique laborering ministry God has in store for their life.
