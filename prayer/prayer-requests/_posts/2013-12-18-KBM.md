***The Experience:***
Pray for safe travel as students arrive May 16th and for a great start to the summer!  Pray for surrendered and expectant hearts for students, summer interns, and staff team.

***16 Days:***
16 Days begins in less than a month!  Please continue to send your prayers for God's provision with these high school students.  Their tuition cost is $2,000, and many are well on their way.  May each student and their families know God has gone both behind and before them.

***Deep Camp:***
There are no new updates besides the continued request to pray that God would prepare hearts, minds, individuals, and families for this impactful week!  Also, please continue to pray for the planning of each day and for all the logistical elements to fall rightfully into place.
