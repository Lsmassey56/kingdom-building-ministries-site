***The Experience:***
Thank you for praying!  The Team Call was amazing.  The group's excitement filled the room and they were very willing to share and participate.  There are six more weeks until they arrive!  In the past two weeks, a handful of students were accepted - they especially would appreciate your prayers in reaching their financial goals given a short time to fundraise.  May the whole team know God has their summer in His hands.

***16 Days:***
We praise God for these high school students who are passionately pursuing their relationship with Jesus Christ!  Pray this week, that their hearts would be encouraged in their desire to shine the light and love of Jesus in their schools, homes, churches, and communities.

***Deep Camp:***
We hope to see many NEW faces at Deep Camp this summer!  Please pray with us as we commit all details and logistical aspects of Deep Camp to God.  Rooms are being reserved, space is being booked and services are being planned!  Please pray that individuals and families respond to God's leading to come and that God would make a way financially.  Several churches are considering promoting Deep Camp to their congregations!  Praise God!
