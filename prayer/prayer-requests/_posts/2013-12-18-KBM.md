***The Experience:***
The Experience teams arrived back to Denver safely!  To read about their final week overseas, visit <a href="http://www.kbm.org/blog/" target="_blank">kbm.org/blog</a>.  Pray for God's provision for rest and recovery as they jump into a week of "baton passing" at Deep Camp, where they will facilitate group discussions with middle and high school students.

***16 Days:***
Yesterday the 16 Days team graduated!  Thank you for all of your prayers.  Lives were truly changed while encountering the living God.  Click <a href="http://www.kbm.org/blog/2014/06/21/16-days-graduation-live/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to watch the live recording of the graduation.  Please pray for their transition home - may each student be filled with peace, courage and joy stepping into the new chapter ahead.

***Deep Camp:***
Deep Camp is finally here!  Each day is filled with opportunity for each participant to grow closer to God and invite Him into every aspect of their lives.  Pray for powerful encounters with God that transform each young adult, mom, dad, child, high schooler, grandma and grandpa.
