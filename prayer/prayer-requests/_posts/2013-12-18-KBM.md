***The Experience:***
Thank you for your prayers as the team poured out God's love to the young students who attended Deep Camp.  They were amazed at the ways God worked through them to help each student develop a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ. This week, pray the team would follow God's leading as they embark on Wander Week!

***16 Days:***
Continue to pray for the team's transition home - may each student be filled with peace, courage and joy stepping into the new chapter ahead.

***Deep Camp:***
What a week!  God was on the move and He used your prayers in powerful ways.  God's light and truth transformed hearts and lives through impactful times of worship, teaching and discussion.  As participants return from the mountains, please pray they would continue seeking God wholeheartedly and rely on the power of the Holy Spirit to fill, lead and teach them along the way.
