***The Experience:***
Students are on the home stretch!  In just three weeks they will arrive in Colorado. Collectively, there is still a significant financial goal for the students and summer staff to reach - please keep praying for them to persevere in their efforts and in belief!

***16 Days:***
Such pivotal moments take place during high school!  That's why we're so thrilled that more and more from this age group are wanting to take serious steps in knowing Jesus Christ and making Him Lord of their life.  Thank you for your prayers - God has so much in store for this team this summer.  Pray that God would continue leading and guiding every decision being made to plan for their time with us.

***Deep Camp:***
We couldn't be more excited about the way plans are falling into place for Deep Camp!  Your prayers have undoubtedly carried these efforts - thank you!  Please continue to pray for God to prepare the hearts of all who are coming and for their relationship with God to be growing deeper even now.
