<p>The mission of KBM is to challenge, equip and mobilize everyday people to become active reproducing Kingdom laborers. As a disciple in action, a laborer puts hands and feet to the call to usher in the Kingdom of God on the earth. </p>

<p>KBM believes the call to laborship requires intentionally entering places of need where God is moving. We are taking initiative to engage God in specific areas to increase the potential of the laborer movement in various places and contexts throughout the world. </p>
