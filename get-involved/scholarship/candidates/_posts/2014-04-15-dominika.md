Dominika is a Political Science and International Relations student who loves singing, playing violin, reading, art, hiking, rock climbing and working with children. She believes God has called her to deepen her intimacy with him so she can experience God's redemption and His healing of past wounds. She is seeking a deeper understanding of God's specific call and purpose for her life. She desires to be free from fear and to serve God more effectively with His power.
