Carley is finishing her first year at Southern Wesleyan University. She came to know Jesus just a few years ago and is hungry for more of Him. She is ready for The Experience and the challenge that will come with it, ready to break through any barriers that would hinder her from knowing God more, and seeking what it means to trust Him with everything. After hearing the truth of the Gospel, she is passionate about sharing that news with others, and is looking for ways to be further equipped to introduce others to Jesus!
