God came alive to Ryan two years ago after he was invited to a college group that pursued him with Christ's love and introduced him to a active and powerful faith walk. Since then Ryan has grown in his knowledge and action as a believer in Jesus. He prays often for his unbelieving family, trusting God will pursue them as he did Ryan, bringing them into relationship with Jesus. Ryan believes the opportunity to deepen his intimacy with God at The Experience will fuel his passion to serve and give back to his community.
