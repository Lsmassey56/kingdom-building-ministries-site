Jamey was drawn to The Experience after his brother participated in KBM Training in 2011. He endured a difficult childhood where God miraculously pursued him and protected him from the grip of darkness. Jamey has a deep desire to engage in a closer relationship with God, experiencing his forgiveness and grace more practically. He believes The Experience will mature and train him to be in active fellowship with God and provide tools for reaching those around him with the Gospel.
