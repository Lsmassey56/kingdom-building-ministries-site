Darren is an American Born Chinese student who plays drums in Wheaton College's Jazz Combo, enjoys photography, cooking, hiking, camping and backpacking. As a young child he met Jesus at an after school program. After that his knowledge of Jesus grew and became so impactful in his life that he began sharing his faith with his non-believing family. Darren is convicted that the Gospel is too good not to share! At The Experience Darren hopes to gain deeper insight into his identity (who God has made him to be) and his destiny (what God has planned for his vocation).
