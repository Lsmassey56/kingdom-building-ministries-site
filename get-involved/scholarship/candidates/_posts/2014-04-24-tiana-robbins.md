Tiana is an education major at Southern Wesleyan University. She is passionate about children, especially those with special needs, and is exploring a call to international ministry. She loves painting, photography, and anything crafty. She is anticipating being stretched and challenged during The Experience to step outside of her comfort zone, encounter God in new ways and catch more of a vision for the direction God is leading her life after college.
