Heather loves to create and listen to music, and uses that as a way for her to connect with God. She also loves to be outdoors, hiking, camping, and horse-back riding. Heather has been on two short-term mission trips to Sierra Leone, and hopes to one day return to Africa as a full-time missionary. She was drawn to pursue The Experience after seeing the impact it made in her older sister's life. She hopes that through this summer she will get to encounter Jesus in deep and significant ways and also be further trained to love and serve those around her in her future.
