Hannah is a graduate of Kingdom Building Ministries' youth discipleship training program, 16 Days. She loves art and pouring her life into youth. Hannah has a huge desire to serve in missions, loves people and desires to advance God's kingdom, not hers. She deeply wants to be used by God. She's ready to gain more knowledge, but truly longs for a bigger heart and believes that God's work through The Experience will stretch her and launch her into a new level of humility and impact for the King.
