Devin attends coll√®ge full time but uses part time work and daily interactions with others as strategic ministry opportunities to spread the light of Jesus in dark places. In high school God rescued him from the fruitlessness of self-centered living and in some of his darkest moments captured his life with freedom though grace and forgiveness. Now he's on mission to be challenged and drawn outside of his comfort zone so he can discover how to focus the passion God's given him for kingdom impact.
