Andrew loves outdoor activity, earning his Eagle Scout while serving in several leadership positions in the Boy Scouts. He has used various leadership positions in the scouts, FCA and at an elementary school to mentor and spiritually lead younger students. Andrew wants to be challenged to new levels in his faith, pushed out of his comfort zone and brought to a new realization of needing to depend on God with everything he does. He desires a deeper level of intimacy with God in the context of being discipled by others â€¦so that he can in turn be more effective as discipler and spiritual leader of those God puts in his path.
