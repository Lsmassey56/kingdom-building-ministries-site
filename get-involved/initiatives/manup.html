                    <p>The body of Christ is in need of men who are courageously living intentional Kingdom lives. KBM is passionate to see men spiritually and passionately leading in their families, communities, churches and workplaces – to be living with masculine hearts on fire!</p>

                    <p>We are committed to helping raise up generations of men who will labor as godly husbands, fathers, sons, brothers and friends. In whatever role men may be found, we believe the Kingdom needs to be advanced through men living out their Kingdom identity.</p>

                    <p>May men answer the call to Man Up and devote their lives to the King!</p>
