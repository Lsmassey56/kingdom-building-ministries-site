                <h1><a href="/lifeplan"><span>Life</span> Planning</a></h1>God's plan is to see you experience the fullness of His Kingdom in your life and become a laborer for Him wherever you go and in whatever you do. God wants to show up in all the same places you frequent and use you to touch lives one at a time in your own unique way - just like Jesus did when He lived on earth. The LifePlan experience is a one-on-one, two-day process led by a trained facilitator, followed by personal coaching. The LifePlan process will help you gain greater life perspective, discover your unique design and find purpose and direction in every area of your life. Through this, we believe you will be able to more intentionally and effectively live out the abundant life of laborership that God created you to live.
