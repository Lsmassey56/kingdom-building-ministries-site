">Of course you would! You want your life to matter far beyond your footprints. And what if you had the power to double such transformational impact through your life? Wouldn't you want to jump on that opportunity even more?</p>

    <p>We are thrilled to share that through a small group of faith-filled laborers, God has provided an amazing opportunity through a "Match Fund! Between now and December 31st, your financial gifts have the potential to be doubled, up to $150,000!</p>

    <div style="clear:both;"></div>

    <h2>How the 2013 Match opportunity works:</h2>

    <p>Every dollar from NEW contributors to KBM will be matched.<br>
    Every dollar above and beyond what an existing contributor gave in 2012 will be doubled.</p>

    <p>Please take two minutes to watch Dr. Dwight Robertson, founder and president of Kingdom Building Ministries, explain how you can make an eternal difference with your life today.</p>

    <p>We are praising God for His amazing faithfulness! Pray and inquire how the Lord of the harvest might be leading you to invest in this Kingdom-advancing opportunity!</p><a style="" href="http://weblink.donorperfect.com/kbmdonate" target="_blank">
