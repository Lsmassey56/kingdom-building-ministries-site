# *VISION*:

Kingdom Building Ministries believes that the Kingdom impact of one life laboring with a heart on fire and a life on purpose creates exponential impact. Jesus intentionally invested much of his time with a few men who impacted the world for the glory of God. [KBM Discipleship Training](/training) seeks to create an environment where students will encounter God in life-changing ways.

**YOUR INVESTMENT IN PROVIDING A SCHOLARSHIP TO ONE LIFE HAS GREAT KINGDOM VALUE!**

*Would you co-labor with students who right now are walking this faith journey?* In addition to their personal investment, each student is asked raise support for their training. This creates an opportunity for them to encounter God as Provider. However, some students have limited resources and are unable to raise the full tuition they need.
