                    <p>Our Heavenly Father, the One who sees from heaven, commanded through His Son Jesus that our first step in approaching the harvest field around us is to get on our knees and PRAY.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus made a circuit of all the towns and villages. He taught in their meeting places, reported kingdom news, and healed their diseased bodies, healed their bruised and hurt lives. When he looked out over the crowds, his heart broke. So confused and aimless they were, like sheep with no shepherd. “What a huge harvest!” he said to his disciples. “How few workers! On your knees and pray for harvest hands!” (Matthew 9:37-38 message).</p>

                    <p>What would happen if God's people prayed for more hearts to be awakened to live a life of laboring for the Kingdom; for more lives to give their efforts to glorifying the King of Kings; for more communities to evidence the touch that the Kingdom of God has come near? Let's depend on our Heavenly Father and co-labor together, opening our hearts to the call to pray and intercede daily that more everyday, ordinary laborers will allow God to touch others through them!</p>
