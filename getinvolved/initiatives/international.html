                    <h1>International Initiative</h1>

                    <p>The call for laborers (Matthew 9:35-38) living with hearts on fire and lives on purpose knows no geographical boundaries, ethnic separation, race differentiation or language specification. Humanity, in its entirety, is a mosaic expression of man being created in the image of God. KBM continues to encounter Kingdom hearted people around the world who carry the same burden, to challenge and equip Christians to be Kingdom Laborers.</p>

                    <p>The Spirit is growing an increasing burden for international involvement on the hearts of KBM staff. In recent years KBM has leveraged indigenous partnership to equip laborers across multiple continents, but we believe God has greater things in store.</p>
