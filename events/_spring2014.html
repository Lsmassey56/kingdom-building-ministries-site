            <h2>Group Life Plan</h2>
            <h3>APRIL 11 - 12</h3>
            <p>The <a href="/training/lifeplan">Life Plan</a> experience is a day and a half long process led by trained facilitators. The Life Plan process will help you gain greater life perspective, discover your unique design and find purpose and direction in every area of your life. Through this, we believe you will be able to more intentionally and effectively live out the abundant life of laborership that God created you to live.</p> 

            <p>A signature mark of the Life Plan process is a heavy emphasis on gaining full perspective. The first day is spent reaching full perspective on where you stand today, how you got to where you are, and what God has called you to do and become (and consequently, what you shouldn't do or become). The process moves you into further clarity and breakthroughs in each of your five life domains (Personal, Family, Vocation, Kingdom, and World). The last half-day is spent crafting plans for each life domain and creating an accountability and management framework to help you manage and renew your Life Plan in the future.</p>
