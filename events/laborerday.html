              What a great opportunity for us as Christians to repurpose a special weekend like this as a celebration of all God is doing right now to raise up an army of everyday Kingdom laborers, their "hearts on fire" and "lives on purpose"! As Christians everywhere are being challenged and equipped to become God's everyday "laborers" in every facet and sphere of society - exciting new Kingdom advances are occurring - nationwide and around the world! We're excited to share this brief video with you and additionally provide  a free "YOUnique Ministry" training video through the additional link below. On behalf of our entire team at Kingdom Building Ministries, we hope you will be inspired and encouraged by the significant impact YOU can have in what God has willed for us ALL as His everyday YOUnique Kingdom laborERs!<br>
              <br>
              A very joyful and blessed LaborER Day weekend to YOU!<br>
