                <p><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>Ken</strong></span> earned a football scholarship from the University of Tulsa in 1979 and a B.S. in Education in 1984. After graduation, a knee injury kept Ken from pursuing his dream of a pro-football career and went on to serve as a police officer in the inner city of Tulsa, OK for six years.</p>

                <p>Ken left his commission in 1989, left the police department, and moved to Indianapolis, IN to work for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He later became the protestant chaplain for the Indianapolis Colts, a position that he still holds today.</p>

                <p>In a effort to do more and to be "a part of the solution", he founded Helping Hand Group, Inc., an organization dedicated to serving the plight of inner-city youth. He is currently President and Founder of Ken Johnson Enterprises, Inc., and is a nationally known motivational and assembly conference speaker, evangelist, and recording artist.</p>

                <p>Married to his wife Della since 1983, they have three children: Dominick, Kendall, and Kristina. Ken and his family currently reside in Indianapolis, IN. For more, visit Ken's website at <a href="http://www.kenjohnson.org">www.kenjohnson.org</a></p>
