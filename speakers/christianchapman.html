Christian’s success in college baseball led to playing with Athletes in Action where as a missionary he worked with South African nationals to develop an olympic-grade team. He’s competed nationally in a professional golf “Longest Drive” competition, raced motocross, and most recently has taken part in a racing-themed reality series on Spike TV.</p>

                <p>No matter where God has led Christian, preaching and evangelizing have been part of his calling. His natural charisma and experiences in sports have led to international ministry opportunities where he’s led Bible studies for Nascar teams and motocross racers, served as chaplain to football teams, and pastored collegians at Clemson University.</p>

                <p>Christian has served as staff pastor at several churches ministering to youth, young adults, and adults, preaching the Word, training church planters, and investing in the spiritual growth of those in his care.</p>
