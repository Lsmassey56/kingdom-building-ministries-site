                    <h1><em>John</em> Vermilya</h1><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>John</strong></span> Vermilya is a gifted communicator whose ministry focus is to stir Christians to move beyond spiritual apathy, stagnancy and religiosity, and instead embrace a life of passion and purpose by actually becoming a follower of Christ with all the unpredictability and risk that it entails. Through storytelling, humor and reflecting upon his own Christian walk, John is able to connect with audiences of various ages and challenge and encourage them in their spiritual journey.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>THE RESISTANCE</strong>: A challenge to listeners to take action and join the resistance against the spiritual occupation of Satan and his forces of evil.</li>

                    <li><strong>DOMINO</strong>: Does it ever seem like those up front get all the glory for what really took the combined efforts of many working behind the scenes? Here's a call to humbly obey Jesus.</li>

                    <li><strong>WHO'S YOUR DADDY?</strong>: Drawing from a memorable scene in the film Remember The Titans, John Vermilya turns the question on us. God is truly our father and we serve submissively at His pleasure.</li>

                    <li><strong>GET IN THE GAME</strong>: Every Christ follower is issued an "unseen" jersey. Are you wearing yours?</li>

                    <li><strong>ANT HILL</strong>: Life without relationship with God has no meaning or purpose.</li>

                    <li><strong>RADICAL COMMITMENT</strong>: The Christian life is meant to be lived sold out to Jesus Christ.</li>

                    <li><strong>SECRETS OF THE KINGDOM</strong>: Transformation doesn’t come by trying harder; it comes from time spent with God.</li>

                    <li><strong>ELIJAH - A MAN LIKE US</strong>: An inspirational look at the prophet Elijah and its ramifications of how I view my own life.</li>
