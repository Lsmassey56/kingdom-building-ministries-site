                    <h1><em>Robert</em> Gelinas</h1><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>Robert</strong></span> Gelinas currently serves as the Lead Pastor of Colorado Community Church in Denver, CO. It is his privilege to serve this transformative, city-reaching, multi-cultural, multi-campus church. This fits Robert's deep desire to see the body of Christ empowered to serve the least of these. The poor, the down and out, the disabled, those deemed unimportant and the unborn. Robert knows that God loves all people yet he has a special heart for the poor and the poor in spirit, the miserable and the marginalized. This is why he has spent time teaching some fundamentals of urban ministry. In addition he's the founder of Project 127; a ministry dedicated to seeing the day when there are no children waiting for homes in Colorado's foster care system.

                <h2>Ministry Passions</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Kingdom of God – Every believer has a significant role in the Kingdom!</li>

                    <li>The Least of These – reaching out to the poor, the down and out, the disabled, and those deemed unimportant!</li>

                    <li>Adoption – just look at his family and you can see he cares deeply about children in need.</li>

                    <li>Transformation – encouraging the body of Christ to be active laborers for God, reaching out to others.</li>

                    <li>Community – moving from division to unity in the church, neighborhoods, and communities in which we live.</li>

                    <li>Jazz Theology – Fundamental to jazz is Call & Response, syncopation and improvisation. A jazz theologian takes these concepts and then applies them to following Christ and living out his glorious gospel of the Kingdom of God.</li>
