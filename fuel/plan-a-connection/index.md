The core of the "Plan A" message is to reveal God's passion to use ordinary people to do extraordinary things in building His Kingdom. Each one of us not only has something to contribute, but also has a story to tell. That's what why we built "The Connection." It's a place for you to share your story and be encouraged by the stories of others. And "The Connection" will only grow in value with timeâ€”as more people leave their stories of how God has revealed and worked His plan in their lives. You are God's Plan A!

Jesus talked a lot about Plan A when He was on earth, and He gave us a model for how to live it out. Problem is, we've watered it down. Distorted it. Added to it. Subtracted from it. Forgotten about parts of it. And combined it with our own plans. It's time to return to the fullness of God's Plan A and recover, renew, and revitalize it in our generation. The fate of the world depends on it.
