#“*BATON* PASSING” Relationships  

**Successful Spiritual Multiplication**  

In the book [You are God’s Plan A…and There’s No Plan B](/fuel/plan-a-book), the concept of spiritual multiplication relationships (as modeled by Jesus) is likened to “baton passing” in a relay race. As a valuable Kingdom laborer, scripture tells you to “run with perseverance the race marked out for you” and to also (Jesus modeled this) “pass on” everything you’ve received for other relay runners to successfully carry God’s love and plan into times and places you will never go. You’re part of a “Kingdom relay team”!

##BATON PASSING Q & A's:

Q: **What’s the baton composed of?**  

A: “The baton” is the spiritual wealth God has given you which can help other people near you function with greater influence, spiritual energy, strength, confidence, fervor, focus, knowledge, or speed.

Q: **Who should be on the receiving end of the baton?**  
 
A: God will prompt you as you seek his guidance (see Chapter 14 “Along the Way”). He knows what you have to offer and who needs it most. As the one passing the baton, you must be the initiator and pursuer of the other person’s growth. Baton passing relationships work best when the two people are of the same gender. The “receiver” must be reliable (II Timothy 2:2), hungry for God and his truth, demonstrate a teachable spirit, show respect for you, and desire to live a God-pleasing life of spiritual obedience and influence. 

Q: **What does it mean to pass the baton?**  

A: Passing the baton means freely sharing your spiritual wealth with others. Any time, way, or thing God has taught you, encouraged you, or allowed you to learn from others—and you share it with people for their spiritual growth and Plan A living—you are baton passing. It usually occurs in the context of relationships, so it develops organically (informally) rather than systematically (formally).

Q: **When do I pass the baton?**  

A: When you live and train as a Plan A runner on God’s “relay team,” you see runners everywhere to whom you can pass the baton. Be aware that they may pass a baton to you as well. But as you actively seek out other runners, you will discover endless opportunities to talk, pray, encourage, bless, and pass everything you can to them.

Q: **Who does the passing?**  

A: If you assume you have very little to offer, you may be equating “passing the baton” with an information brain-dump. But the best “passers” are people with practical tips that come from real-life experience. Earlier in the race, they received help from God and others, and know first-hand how to run a strong race. 

Runners best suited for “baton passing” include:

1. **People who love God passionately.** St Augustine once said, “By one who loveth is another kindled.” Like an artesian well, your love for God will naturally flow out of you and affect the people around you, making them thirsty for the same water. That’s why Jesus said the main goal in life is to, “Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
2. **People who accept their unworthiness—and Christ’s worthiness.** God calls us to point people to Jesus (see Chapter 17 “You Can Make An Impact, One Life At A Time”). We’re not the answer, he is!
3. **People who feel “unprepared” but are unwilling to see others live without encouragement, instruction, affirmation, and help.**  Regardless of your training or experience, impart whatever God reveals to you that might enhance someone else’s journey. 
4. People willing to love and care deeply about others. People don’t care about how much you know or what you offer until they sense how much you love and care about them (see Chapter 6 “Finding People To Love”).
5. **Imperfect people.** People who see themselves as needy grace-receivers make the best grace-extenders. Jesus’ disciples weren’t perfect. In John 21, after rising from the dead, Jesus discovered that seven of his disciples had returned to their vocations as fishers of fish, rather than men. After his aggressive, hands-on, baton-passing personal training with them, they were failing to pass the baton to anyone else. But instead of tearing them apart, he fixed them breakfast.  And he reminded Peter—who failed most miserably—what mattered most: loving him.
6. **People willing to listen vertically and horizontally.** When you’re spending time with people, be 100% fully engaged. Slow down, and avoid looking at your watch or answering your cell phone. 
Ask them about their family history, parents, beliefs, what they think of themselves, their best memories, their worst, the times when they experienced rejection, loss, pain, and how they have felt about it. Watch how they interact with people, how they handle difficult circumstances, and how they function under pressure. Ask them what they sense about their future. Observe them with all your senses. That’s what it means to “listen” horizontally. But listen vertically too - asking God to reveal to you what he sees. Moment-by-moment, attentively listen to God as you’re “listening” to their heart and life. Notice God telling you what to say, what to give, how to network them with others, how to pray for them, and exactly what he desires you to “pass” to them.  
8. **People willing to cheer and express great belief in others and God’s design for them.**  Many people could be thriving, but are barely surviving. Why? They’re weighed down by self-doubt and negative verdicts from cruel children or hurtful parents. Enough cold water throwers exist in the world. Flame stirrers are needed – people seeking the glowing embers of what God’s placed in others and releasing them with confident verbal and written expressions of value and hope that comes from knowing God’s plan involves everyone. 
9. **People willing to embody the Plan A “baton pass” as a lifestyle.** God wants co-laborers who see, value, and cherish people as his Plan A—continually investing in others just like Jesus.
10. **People who make God’s Word paramount.** When you accept the paramount endurance and power of Scripture, you will study God’s word with them, mutually share practical observations and insights, and co-memorize Scripture together.
11. **People who want to pass on their spiritual wealth so other kingdom runners will have greater future advantages.** Share helpful insights or tips gained through the years, favorite Scripture passages, uplifting Christian music, a Christian book, a helpful ministry website, a Christian radio station or program, an audio or video resource that’s encouraged you. Anything that’s helped you love God and love others better is spiritual wealth to offer. Be generous.  

Q: **What does it look like to pass the baton?**  
A: Your passing skills will develop as you become a student of their life, learning to recognize their strengths and weaknesses.  

Affirm their strengths every way you can—speak them out loud, in print, in front of others, and when you pray with them, thanking God for his plans to further his kingdom through them.  

Assessing their weak areas will lead your focus to development of character and perseverance. God will reveal the areas for concern and then help you discern the best way to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). Seek God’s continual presence and help in the process of this delicate soul surgery.  

Notice the way Larry Crabb conveys this idea in his important book Connecting: 
“When I sense that you want to discover what’s wrong with me and change me, I will either slide into passivity (“Go ahead! Fix me!”) or raise myself up to an arrogant height (“I can handle things. I’ll consider what you say, but I’ll make sure I don’t buy all of it!”). But when I know that you love me, that you believe in me, that you recognize something terrific in me, that you long to see my potential released, I’m more inclined to receive you and let you pour into my life.”

We trust people who delight in us, who see the good beneath the bad and call out the good.  

##PRACTICAL BATON PASSING TIPS:

Here are a few practical tips to help keep it simple:  

1. **Never underestimate the value of doing things together.** One of the most meaningful nights I invested in the life of a young man occurred during a rain-out at a baseball game, when traffic halted to a standstill on the freeway and our return trip from the game took much longer. Our long ride home provided an opportunity for him to share deep pain from his past, along with present and future challenges.  

2. **Be second.** Point people to Jesus and Scripture.  When John the Baptist’s disciples began defecting to Jesus, he commented, “He must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30 RSV).  John’s example shows us how to “be second” and point toward the One who is first.  

3. **Release them into God’s leadership and destiny—and not your agenda—for their lives.** Guard against selfishly tying them to you, your ministry pursuits, or your geographical location. “Release them” over and over again. Far too many spiritual harvest fields lack laborers because the people raising them became too personally attached to “release” them into their own unique field of service.  

4. **Pray for them.** Bathe them in prayer—praying for and with your baton receivers. Jesus modeled this in John 17 when he warned Peter that rough days were ahead: “Satan wants to sift you…but I have prayed for you.”  

5. **Do an “inventory”—know what’s helped you in the past.** A Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon could provide enough time for a fast inventory of your life. List life-impacting Scriptures, books that helped you, ministries, experiences, people, audio recordings of speakers or music, annual events, etc.—anything God used to strengthen your love for him and your love for others. Now, how can you “pass” these blessed resources to others?  

6. **Introduce them to other inspiring Kingdom laborers.** Give them a life biography in a book or on CD. Then discuss it together. I’ve often shared the audio testimony of Dawson Trotman with men I was coming alongside. Introducing them to other “hearts on fire and lives on purpose” will encourage, inspire, even stretch them. Go ahead, enhance their network and watch “iron sharpen iron”.  

7. **Prepare them for what’s ahead.** Concern yourself with their roots—because they won’t grow taller or wider in spiritual influence unless they go deeper and broader in their spiritual depth. Ensure that they practice important spiritual disciplines- daily time with God and his Word, regular connections with other believers, prayer, Bible study, Scripture memorization, perhaps journaling, and definitely a lifestyle of worship. These practices will act as deep roots that will keep them strong, nourished, and secure when the storms of life blow against them. 
They need to know that storms will come. The enemy of their souls will try to bring them down. Discuss the realities of spiritual warfare and what “overcomers” have found helpful. Let them know that the more their life poses a threat to the enemy, the more he will oppose them. But remind them to “take heart” because Jesus said, “I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).  

8. **Address the hard issues.** God’s goal for us is not to make us happy. His goal is to form us into the image of Christ. He loves us more than he loves our happiness. When God conforms us into the image of Jesus, he cuts away everything that is not like him.  
In the same way, you must care so much about your young laborer that you’re willing to address anything that potentially stands in the way of them becoming more like Christ.  Paul addressed Timothy’s tendency toward being timid and hesitant about his young age.  
In addressing hard issues, realize that love’s most subtle enemy is not hate—it’s indifference. But make sure they’re convinced that you absolutely and unconditionally love and believe in them. Early in my baton-passing relationships I often say, “There is nothing you will ever do, say or reveal that will cause me to withdraw my love for you. You’re stuck with me.” Unconditional love demands no retreats.  
Don’t allow negative feedback from others (people avoiding them, being offended by them, experiencing difficulty responding to them) to continue because you never cared enough to address these hard issues, when you knew they existed. Otherwise they may repeatedly strive, weep, try again, but suffer continuing challenges and unfruitfulness because no one loved them enough to help them.  Love them too much to be silent.  If you don’t, who will?  

9. ** Adopt them for a lifetime.** You may not invest much further time throughout the years to come, but your personal interest in them should never wane.  They’re God’s assignment for you - part of your legacy. Follow their lives with interest. Be available for counsel if they ask it of you. Your ongoing prayers and interest will always be important to them—even after regular contact becomes only occasional.  

10. **Cast and release vision for their future life-impact—no matter what!** In spite of his inconsistent blunderings, Jesus renamed Peter “the Rock” and gave him faith for a brighter future (Matthew 16:18).  
I actually wonder where I’d be today if my earthly father, who faced more challenges raising me than most parents, had not seen past my behavior with eyes of future hope and belief. He continually cast vision and released blessing for me when despair and hopelessness would have been a natural response. After some of my worst moments, my father would stop by my bedroom door at night and say, “Son when (not “if”) you get all that energy moving the right direction, you’re going to have a great life.” What a gift of vision, hope, and encouragement!  
Your words, “like a great forest…set on fire by a small spark” (James 3:5), could release God’s destiny in someone near your life.  
People wrestle more than you could ever imagine with long-rehearsed lies - negativity that the Accuser of the Brethren (Satan) has pronounced over them.  Pray God will reveal truths from His Word which they and you can use to retaliate against Satan’s strategy to keep God’s Plan A laborers immobilized.  
Ask God to share his vision for them and what works he has “prepared in advance for [them] to do” (Ephesians 2:10)—and then bless and visionize the socks off them!  

##THE NOURISHMENT OF ENCOURAGEMENT:

At the outset of Jesus’ public ministry, his Father sent him encouragement from the heavens saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17). 

Like runners need fuel in the form of nourishment to run strong and hard, laborers need the nourishment of encouragement to run strong and hard.  Ask anyone who’s received the gift and blessing of encouragement—they’ll tell you it renews their energy and drive to run the race God has marked out for them. No wonder God the Father provided his son, Jesus, the nourishment of encouragement for the race set before him. 

Jesus passed on the same nourishment he received from his father to other future runners. Before witnessing any signs of success, he encouraged Peter by saying, “I’m going to build my church on you.” He encouraged James and John by giving them extra time and attention. Together, Peter, James, and John established the first church in Jerusalem—and later Peter became the “Rock” of the church in Rome. 

After his resurrection from the dead, Jesus also invested extra time and attention encouraging a less-promising relay-runner, Thomas. With his newfound belief in Jesus’ resurrection, Thomas ran all the way to Carola, India before passing his “baton.” 

Jesus’ encouragement inspired and nourished ordinary men to move beyond their self-doubts to surpass the accomplishments of all the people of their day. He expressed his belief in them, spent time with them, offered them his love and blessing. And we eventually witness them running Spirit-empowered, soul-stirring, action-packed races in the book of Acts. 

My high school track coach modeled this kind of encouragement. He dressed in athletic gear like the rest of us and then ran beside us, demonstrating proper running techniques and depth of running commitment. He replicated this in other field events like pole-vaulting or shot-putting…always inspiring us by setting an example for us to follow. Then he watched us closely and worked with us to turn our weaknesses into strengths, tailoring his words and actions to each individual athlete. We became far better athletes than we ever imagined because he nourished us through an environment of encouragement. 

For years I’ve been doing the same in ministry settings and have watched countless young men and women rise-up and live-out extraordinary legacies because of the amazing nourishment encouragement brings

You can provide that same kind of influence for those near your life by expressing belief in them and in God’s plans for their lives. Then help them believe it, too. This Scriptural strategy is the basis for an audio message I often teach entitled, “Advancing God’s Kingdom—One Life at a Time.”  

Unfortunately, we vastly underutilize this powerful nourishment of encouragement. God intentionally issued his command in Hebrews 3:13 to “Encourage one another daily.” When we neglect this important supplement, fatigue and diminished results will be evident. 

Kingdom advances are greater wherever efforts are greater, efforts are greater wherever courage is greater, and courage is greater wherever encouragers are at work!

##DROPPING THE BATON

Because Jesus knew his leg of the race would last only three years, he focused on passing the baton to his disciples and training them to do the same. In this way, he ensured that his all-important movement would continue for generations to come in lands yet to be explored. 

He gave his disciples clear instructions: “Go and make disciples of all nations...teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19-20, emphasis added). In a sense, Jesus instructed his runners to “pass batons” in every nation by teaching others what he had taught them. 

Following Jesus’ lead, Paul passed the baton to Timothy, telling him, “The things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others” (2 Timothy 2:2).

With such clear instructions, why do so many people drop the baton?

Comma blindness. In the process of reading this book, you have obviously encountered an assortment of punctuation marks: A period (.) here, a comma (,) there, and, periodically, an impressive exclamation point (!). People often view their lives in the form of one of these punctuation marks.

Many people focus their lives on a singular endpoint, just like a period at the end of a sentence. Life exists in the here and now. Rather than join God in what he’s doing in other people’s lives, they only live for themselves. So when their lives are over, it’s over, and no one carries the baton beyond their lives.

Other people live like an exclamation mark. They take risks and relish impacting people near and far. Their “life-splash” makes a big wake. Some even live in such a way that through them, many hear about Jesus. We remember people like this when they die. 

Yet, while people of this caliber bring great value to the kingdom of God, their lives end with an exclamation mark. Did you get that? Their lives end. While living in the exclamation mark is good, there is a better way. 

But the way to make a mark is to live in the comma. If you remember, a comma links one part of a sentence with another. And commas always appear in lists. Endless lists. Think of the long list of begats in Matthew 1 and Luke 3. 

People who live in the comma pass the baton to others—just like Abraham passed the baton to Isaac (in Matthew 1) or like Mary passed the baton to Jesus. They intentionally look for people who they can bless, encourage, or equip. While other people suffer from comma blindness (focusing on themselves or making a singular impact), people who live in the comma continually pass their batons to others. In that way, their legacy never comes to an end.

Spiritual hoarding. Think of all the sermons you’ve heard, the books you’ve read, and the conversations you’ve shared that have contributed to your vast spiritual reserves. You’re rich! The Corinthians were, too. Paul told them, “You have been enriched in every way” (1 Corinthians 1:5). 

Maybe you’ve been bothered by wealthy friends or acquaintances you think should share more of what they have. How can they hoard so much when others have so little?  

But when righteous indignation rises up in situations like these, we need to turn the mirror back on ourselves. We, too, could be hoarding, but in a different way.

Wealth isn’t just about money.

Consider the vast spiritual resources God has given you. Are you seeking to share as much as you can from all the blessings God has given you? People in your realm of influence need what you have—and your little spiritual storehouse (if you passed it to them) would go so far. 

Jesus told his disciples that everything he was passing on to them, he had received from his Father. Eventually that trickle-down spiritual wealth found its way to our generation, ultimately changing you and me. But what if Jesus had chosen to hoard the spiritual wealth he had received? What if his disciples—who didn’t possess “silver or gold” but gave so much more—chose to hoard their spiritual wealth? 

So much hinges on spiritual “wealth-sharing.”

So stop hoarding and start passing!

Insecurity. You could spend a lifetime telling yourself, “I don’t know enough.”  
But when will you know enough? How will you know when you know enough? Does anyone know enough? And most importantly, how could God accomplish his Plan A if he only calls the few people who know enough—whatever that means?

Peter passed the all-important baton Jesus gave him when he tells us, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (2 Peter 1:3). 

God has already given you everything you need for life. Everything! He’s already given you everything you need to pour the life he has given you into the life of someone else.

If God has ever encouraged you through his word…then pass it on. 

If God has ever taught you anything through your life experiences…then pass it on. 

If God has helped you through books and other digital resources…then pass it on. 

If God has imparted any important lessons through personal life failures…then pass it on. 

Pass on to others anything that God has given you.

You can’t say you don’t know enough when God has already given you everything you need to follow him.

##IT’S YOUR TURN!

Imagine that you’re a part of a relay team. The runner before you has placed the baton in your hand. Now it’s your turn. 

You begin running your leg of the race as swiftly as you can. You stumble here and there, but you keep getting up. You know that all runners stumble from time to time in this race. 

You round the corner of the track and you see a teammate standing before you with an outstretched arm. The runner’s gaze is fixed ahead as you begin your approach. 

What will you do?

Go ahead. With God’s Spirit helping you ...pass your baton.

Would you take a moment right now and ask God who should be on the receiving end?
