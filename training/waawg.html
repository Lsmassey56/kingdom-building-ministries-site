                    <br>
                    Consider that question a moment.<br>
                    <br>

                    <p>Jesus said it best when he told His disciples: “Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me, work with me– watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn how to live freely and lightly.” – Matthew 11:28 (MSG)</p>

                  <p>What if there was an experience that could move you closer to God’s pleasure and validation in your heart and life? What if that experience would allow you extended time alone with Him either in the wilderness of Colorado or the comfort of a select retreat center over a weekend? What if that experience also included heart and soul connected time with a small group of other folks committed to the same pursuit?</p>

                  <p>That would be a <em>WAAWG</em>: <strong>Weekend Almost Alone with God.</strong></p>

                  <p>If our King could get you away from technology, obligations, and the busy-ness of your life and get you alone with Him to rest, be restored by His loving touch, and be rejuvenated by the Holy Spirit’s affirmation and empowerment – both you and He would be pleased.</p>

                  <p>Jesus invites you to a more dynamic friendship. Will you accept the invite?</p>
