                    <p>The core of the “Plan A” message is to reveal God’s passion to use ordinary people to do extraordinary things in building His Kingdom. Each one of us not only has something to contribute, but also has a story to tell. The Plan A message challenges people to live out what Jesus talked about and modeled when He was on the earth.</p>

                <p>Plan A Conferences offer local churches the opportunity to equip their church body and community to recognize and intentionally live out their unique Plan A ministry at the workplace, in schools, at the grocery store, in their homes, and in the every day places they find themselves. During the 2-day conference, a KBM speaker will not only challenge and equip people, but conference attendees will have the opportunity to spend individual time listening to God, meeting in small groups to share, debrief and plan intentional next steps.</p>

                <p>It’s time to call people to return to the fullness of God’s Plan A and recover, renew and revitalize it in our generation!</p>
