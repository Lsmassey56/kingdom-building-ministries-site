                    <h1>Stranded</h1>STRANDED is not your typical event, therefore its not for everybody. It is the “Basic Training” of Unusual Soldiers. This training event is for those that have a passion for God, a desire to impact the world, and an adventurous spirit. This beast called Stranded, will test your endurance, character, and mental fortitude as you engage in a mock mission trip to a dangerous region full of tribesmen, wild animals, and rebels. Stranded keeps you on your toes because the script always changes and sometimes it hurts.<br>

                    By the close of SLINGSHOT students will have a full blown strategy on their next steps and how to begin pursuing the vision that God has given them.<br>
