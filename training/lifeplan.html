                    God's plan is to see you experience the fullness of His Kingdom in your life and become a laborer for Him wherever you go and in whatever you do. God wants to show up in all the same places you frequent and use you to touch lives one at a time in your own unique way - just like Jesus did when He lived on earth.

                The LifePlanning process seeks to gain perspective on your life story, assess your gifts, talents and the way you interact with the world around you, incorporate your passions and dreams, while seeking to discover your personal God-given purpose in His Kingdom.

                <h1>What is a LifePlan?</h1>The LifePlan experience is a one-on-one, two-day process led by a trained facilitator, followed by personal coaching. The LifePlan process will help you gain greater life perspective, discover your unique design and find purpose and direction in every area of your life. Through this, we believe you will be able to more intentionally and effectively live out the abundant life of laborship that God created you to live. A signature mark of the LifePlan process is a heavy emphasis on gaining full perspective. The first day and a half is spent reaching full perspective on where you stand today, how you got to where you are, and what God has called you to do and become (and consequently, what you shouldn't do or become). The process moves you into further clarity and breakthroughs in each of your five life domains (Personal, Family, Vocation, Church, and Community). The last half-day is spent crafting plans for each life domain and creating an accountability and management framework to help you manage and renew your LifePlan in the future.

At the end of two days, you will have gained greater clarity, focus, direction and hope, as well as a practical plan to realize your new vision for life as a Kingdom laborer. Your LifePlan will help you integrate and optimize your life purpose and vision into your life domains through customized, doable action plans.

                <h1>Am I ready for a LifePlan?</h1>If you find yourself unfulfilled and out of balance with a desire to more intentionally live in abundance, serving God with your unique talents, a LifePlan could be a good next step for you. However, not everyone is ready for a LifePlan. The LifePlan process is not therapy, counseling, nor prescriptive in its approach. Rather, it is a ‘spiritually dependent’ planning process, which relies on God’s presence to bring out an individual’s insight and wisdom that is needed for personal perspective and decision. The facilitator guides the process and you provide the content throughout the process. Together, with God’s help we create a personalized LifePlan organized around the five domains of your life. If you have an overwhelming need to discover and know your purpose in life, if you have a strong desire to redefine your life mission, or if you simply need help to organize and balance around an already clear life purpose, then you are ready for a LifePlan.<br><br>
