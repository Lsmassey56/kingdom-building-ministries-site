# *16 Days* Frequently Asked Questions 

### What is ***16 Days***? 

***16 Days*** is a fun, challenging, mind-blowing road trip for high school students provided by Kingdom Building Ministries that is designed as an intensive discipleship program. The goal is to give a variety of experiences, one-on-one coaching, classroom teaching, and life skills that will help each student live passionately for Christ (heart on fire) and intentionally impact the world around them with the love of Christ (life on purpose). 
 
There are two phases of the program:  

1. **Intensive Discipleship Phase (16 days)**: In the Intensive Discipleship Phase, students will participate as a team in an adventurous, multi-stop road trip across the country with ministry opportunities, discipleship training and one-on-one coaching packed into a 24/7 schedule all along the way.  

2. **Ministry and Support Phase (24 weeks)**: In the Ministry and Support Phase, one-on-one coaches (assigned to each student during the 16-day Intensive Discipleship Phase) will encourage, pray, and provide accountability for students as they return home and begin to apply what they have learned in the “real world”.  
  
**Who can attend *16 Days*?**  
***16 Days*** is designed for high school students who have given their lives to Christ and desire to grow spiritually. Students who have completed their freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior year are welcome to attend ***16 Days***. 
 
**When and where does *16 Days* take place?**  
***16 Days*** is a road trip, so students will see many places and engage many different environments throughout the program. The Intensive Discipleship Phase (June 7-22) begins and ends in Denver, CO. The Ministry and Support Phase (June 23-Dec 31, 2013) is a distance coaching component that helps the student reengage life back in their home or school environments.  

The Intensive Discipleship Phase of the program starts and ends at the launch location. Twelve days of the program take place in other locations across the US. The Ministry and Support Phase of the program happens back at the student’s home environment, where they will be coached from a distance through electronic communication, phone calls, and prayer support to help them apply what they’ve learned to real life.

We are encouraging students to submit applications as early as possible to facilitate preparation for the summer which includes raising financial support for this discipleship training mission. Students must [apply](/16days/apply) online at least two months before the start of the program.

The cost of the program does not include transportation to and from the launch location or spending money for gifts, trinkets, etc. during the Intensive Discipleship Phase of the program.
