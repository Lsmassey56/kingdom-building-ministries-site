                    <p>Participating in a KBM training program is not as much about DOING MINISTRY (even though you will) as much as it is about becoming a person who lives a lifestyle of actively listening to and boldly following Christ everyday for the rest of your life. We rely on God and seek to equip you to become an active Plan A Kingdom Laborer, who is living out the 6 realities of a Kingdom Laborer. We believe God is using KBM to help fuel a worldwide movement of individuals who are God’s answer to Jesus’ prayer “to send more laborers into his harvest field.” (Matthew 9:38)</p>

                Yes, we believe this is a HUGE task! But, in faith we seek to walk as Jesus walked and invest deeply in a smaller number of people believing that “more time with fewer people equals a great Kingdom investment.” It’s not about formulas for us. It’s not about getting people to perform in a certain way. It is about helping you LOVE GOD more and LOVE OTHERS better (Matthew 22:37) …in the way God made YOU to! We hope to help you discover His plan, His creativity, and His hunger to reach the world through all people including the ordinary, imperfect and not-so-willing ones of us who make up most of His body here on earth. So, because He wants to use ALL of you, we have to cover a lot of ground in your life. Every one of our Laborer’s Institute training opportunities includes (to one degree or another) each of these.

                <h2>1. One-On-One Coaching</h2>We believe that God has an “INDIVIDUALLY-DESIGNED PLAN” for you in the world. So, we create space in each of our programs for you to spend time one-on-one with a trained coach who will be helping you discover what God has for you personally in this life. For some programs this coaching relationship is months long and for other programs its hours long, but we believe that it is important for you to know that God sees and cares about YOU.

That is why we’ll take you “on mission” so you can begin to apply the things you’re learning in the classroom to “real life”. We provide deepening exercises for personal growth, ministry experiences, and group activities that will make real the lessons you are “catching in your head”.

                <h2>4. Skill Development</h2>Often we resist doing things because we simply don’t know how to do them. And often, as Christians, we assume we all know how to skillfully live a Christ-following way of life. In each of our programs, we will help you to develop both basic and advanced skills that will support living a life of growing intimacy with and love for God, as well as, more and more effectively loving and reaching out to others.

In each of our programs you will have the opportunity to be a part of a team and we will intentionally use the team environment to challenge your spiritual growth and help you live out the unity Jesus prayed for (John 17) in your everyday life.

                <h1>Deep & Wide Training Values</h1><br>
                Kingdom Laborers are God’s “Plan A” for communicating His love, grace and truth to the world …and there’s no “Plan B”! As God’s creation, every person is qualified. Each aspect of how God uniquely created YOU is employable by God for His Kingdom advance. The foundation of a Kingdom Laborer’s life is built on God’s values and the focus of a Kingdom Laborer’s legacy is shaped by God’s purposes.<br>
                <br>
                The following list of Deep (loving God) and Wide (loving people) Kingdom values compose the “spiritual DNA” of a growing movement of Kingdom Laborers. As these values begin to characterize a life that is surrendered to God, a reproducing Kingdom Laborer is born!

                <h1>6 Realities of a Kingdom Laborer</h1>Although every person is uniquely created and designed by God, we believe there are 6 common characteristics (or realities) that are shared by every active Kingdom Laborer. As we engage students through Laborer’s Institute training opportunities, we are seeking to outline these 6 realities as the goal for each life. We believe a Kingdom Laborer is someone who is:

                <h2>1. Kingdom Living</h2>Kingdom Laborers seek to glorify God by doing things His Way. The most important way to live out the Kingdom of God is to Love God and Love Others. Everything else flows from these two engagements (Matthew 22:40).

                <h2>2. Passion-Driven</h2>Kingdom Laborers love God so much they will obey Him, sacrifice for Him, suffer because of Him all for the ultimate purpose of glorifying His Name. Someone who is passion-driven will pursue love even into and through suffering, just like Jesus did.

                <h2>3. Presence-Enabled</h2>Kingdom Laborers live lives filled with His Presence. They become a house for God (Hebrews 3:6). They seek to have an intimate relationship with God. They are daily directed by the Holy Spirit and obey His direction in their lives.

Purpose-Fulfilling</h2>Kingdom Laborers live with the understanding that God is advancing His Kingdom throughout the world through the reproduction of disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). But they also live in the unique way he created them—in the situations, relationships, and locations He chooses to place them. Each Kingdom laborer is unique, but all of them live and minister in such a way that God’s Kingdom-advancing purposes are fulfilled.

While they grapple with feelings of being UNWORTHY and too INVALUABLE to have Kingdom Impact, their lives are characterized by believing that Christ has commissioned them to be His ambassadors (Eph 5:20). In addition, as they overcome these common insecurities and allow God to use them, they resist the temptation to become proud and humbly allow God to continue shaping and molding them daily.

                  <h2>6. Impact-Oriented</h2>Kingdom Laborers live intentionally to impact God’s Kingdom. They know that living for Kingdom impact will reap an indestructible, eternal legacy that will bring God glory. And they don’t do it only on Sunday mornings from pulpits and stages. They are actively waiting for God to use them in everyday, along-the-way places and situations where there is the greatest need for Him.
